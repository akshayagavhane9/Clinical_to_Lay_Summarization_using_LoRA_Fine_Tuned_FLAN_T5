To examine the role of polybasic domains in the context of full-length PrPC , we used prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains expressed from Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( sPMCA ) reactions . After \u223c5 rounds of sPMCA , PrPSc molecules lacking the central polybasic domain ( \u0394C ) were formed . Surprisingly , in contrast to wild-type prions , \u0394C-PrPSc prions could bind to and induce quantitative conversion of all the polybasic domain mutant substrates into PrPSc molecules . Remarkably , \u0394C-PrPSc and other polybasic domain PrPSc molecules displayed diminished or absent biological infectivity relative to wild-type PrPSc , despite their ability to seed sPMCA reactions of normal mouse brain homogenate . Thus , \u0394C-PrPSc prions interact with PrPC molecules through a novel interaction mechanism , yielding an expanded substrate range and highly efficient PrPSc propagation . Furthermore , polybasic domain deficient PrPSc molecules provide the first example of dissociation between normal brain homogenate sPMCA seeding ability from biological prion infectivity . These results suggest that the propagation of PrPSc molecules may not depend on a single stereotypic mechanism , but that normal PrPC/PrPSc interaction through polybasic domains may be required to generate prion infectivity .\nPrions are infectious proteinaceous particles that cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases , including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) , bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , and chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) . Prions contain PrPSc , a protease-resistant detergent-insoluble \u03b2-sheet-rich conformer of the normal cellular protein PrPC [1] , [2] . PrPSc is an essential and possibly the sole component of infectious prions . Prion propagation and disease require the presence of PrPC , encoded by the host Prnp gene [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] . Cell-free in vitro propagation systems have emerged as valuable tools to investigate PrPSc and prion propagation [7] . By serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( sPMCA ) , prion infectivity can be propagated in vitro [8] . More rapid and less costly than the gold standard inoculation bioassay , sPMCA has been proposed as an in vitro method to detect prion infectivity [9] . Indeed , samples which seed robust sPMCA propagation have been previously associated with biological infectivity [8] , [10] . However , it is unknown if PrPSc molecules that robustly seed PMCA propagation in wild type brain homogenate are always associated with appropriate levels of specific infectivity . Recent studies have reconstituted infectious PrPSc propagation using purified PrPC substrate and supplementary conversion cofactors , a set of minimal components that appear necessary for prion propagation [11] , [12] . PrPSc appears to propagate by autocatalysis , binding PrPC to induce conversion into a new PrPSc molecule [13] . However , the mechanisms of binding and conversion remain unclear . Studies using motif-grafted antibodies or PrP-derived peptides identified two polybasic regions that bind strongly to PrPSc [14] , [15] , [16] , suggesting that these PrPC domains may serve as docking sites for PrPSc . The N-terminal ( N-PBD , 23\u201328 ) and central ( C-PBD , 100\u2013109 ) polybasic domains both fall in the N-terminal flexible region of PrPC , which is less ordered than the C-terminus [17] , [18] . Antibodies directed at C-PBD can impede prion propagation in cultured cells and in vivo [19] , [20] , possibly by blocking a PrPSc-binding site on PrPC . The polybasic domains may also be involved in interaction with lipid molecules during the conversion process [21] and may affect the structure of misfolded prion protein [22] . Mice overexpressing PrP transgenes lacking amino acids 23\u201388 show reduced prion susceptibility [23] , but these studies did not examine N-PBD in isolation . Transgenic mice with deletions that include C-PBD display lethal neurologic illness , but this phenotype precluded inoculation experiments assessing prion susceptibility [24] , [25] , [26] . The specific role of these domains in the context of the entire PrPC molecule has been studied in N2a cells co-expressing wild-type and mutant PrPC [27] , but biochemical examinations of binding interactions and of propagation with pure substrates are lacking . In full-length PrPC , the relative importance of the N-terminal and central polybasic domains in binding PrPSc is unclear . Moreover , while much evidence points to a significant role for PrPC polybasic domains , it is not known if PrPSc-PrPC interactions are universally stereotypic \u2013 whether all PrPSc molecules use the same PrPC epitopes for interaction . Using a combination of Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell expression , protein purification , and reconstitution sPMCA techniques , we engineered PrPSc molecules lacking polybasic domains . These novel PrPSc molecules , which propagate robustly in vitro , enabled us to assess whether PrPC polybasic domains are universally required for PrPSc docking and propagation . PBD-deficient PrPSc molecules also provided us with a unique opportunity to dissect the relationship between the ability to seed formation of wild type PrPSc molecules in vitro and prion infectivity in vivo .\nSequence encoding mouse PrP-A 23\u2013230 was amplified , using the following primers to add an N-terminal start codon and a C-terminal tag encoding amino acids 410\u2013419 of human c-myc ( NCBI accession number NP_002458 . 2 ) : N: 5\u2032- aaaaaacatatgaaaaagcggccaaagcctggagggt-3\u2032 , C: 5\u2032-aaaactcgagtcattacagatcctcttctgagatgagtttttgttcggatcttctcccgtcgtaatag-3\u2032 . This fusion gene was inserted into pET22b ( + ) for bacterial expression . N-terminal ( \u0394N , 23\u201328 ) and central ( \u0394C , 100\u2013109 ) polybasic domains were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis ( GeneTailor , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . From transfected Escherichia coli Rosetta cells , recombinant PrP was purified in a manner similar to that described by Wang et al . [12] . Cells from 500 mL induced ( Overnight Express Autoinduction System , Novagen , EMD Chemicals , Gibbstown , NJ ) overnight culture were pelleted at 8 , 000\u00d7g for 10 min . ; lysed with 40 mL BugBuster , Lysonase ( Novagen ) , and intermittent sonication over 20 min . ; and inclusion bodies were prepared by two cycles of centrifugation ( 16 , 000\u00d7g , 15 min . ) and 0 . 1\u00d7 Bugbuster resuspension , followed by an additional 16 , 000\u00d7g 15 min . spin . Inclusion body pellets were solubilized in 8 mL 8 M guanidine hydrochloride , insoluble material removed by centrifugation ( 8 , 000\u00d7g , 10 min . ) , and protein added to 3 . 6 g Ni-NTA Hisbind Superflow resin ( Novagen ) pre-equilibrated in denaturing buffer ( 100 mM sodium phosphate , 10 mM Tris , 6 M Guanidine , 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol , pH 8 . 0 ) . After 30 min . binding , resin was transferred to column support , and protein was refolded by a linear 12 hr . 125 mL gradient of denaturing to refolding buffer ( 100 mM sodium phosphate , 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 ) , followed by 60 mL wash at 1 mL/min . in refolding buffer . Protein was eluted from nickel affinity resin by 1 mL/min . 500 mM imidazole , 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 6 . 5; then dialyzed into 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 6 . 5 ( 3\u00d72 L for 30 min . ) and into water ( 3\u00d72 L for 30 min . , 1\u00d74 L overnight ) . If observed , precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 100 , 000\u00d7g for 60 min . The nickel eluate was loaded on 2 mL pre-equilibrated ( 30 mL 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 6 . 5 , 1 mL/min . ) CM sepharose ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) at 0 . 5 mL/min . , washed with 50 mL NaCl at 1 mL/min . , and eluted with a gradient ( 300\u2013650 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mL/min . ) . Fractions containing >0 . 1 OD280 ( >0 . 037 mg/mL PrP ) [28] were pooled and dialyzed into water ( 2\u00d74 L for 30 min . , 1\u00d74 L overnight ) , then stored at \u221270\u00b0C . Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay . RML scrapie-infected brain homogenate ( 5% BH in tris-buffered saline ) or CHO \u0394C-PrPSc ( sPMCA round 16 product , therefore 1016-fold dilution of original wild-type scrapie seed ) were vortexed for 15 sec . , sonicated for 1 min . at 70% power ( Misonix 4000 with Microplate Horn , Qsonica , Newtown , CT ) , and centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 15 min . Normalized amounts of this clarified preparation ( 12 . 4 \u00b5L brain homogenate PrPSc , 16 . 5 \u00b5L PrPSc ) were incubated with 3 . 5 \u00b5g purified E . coli recPrP-myc ( wild-type or lacking polybasic domain ) in 250 \u00b5L binding buffer ( 50 mM tris , 200 mM NaCl , 1% Triton X-100 , 1% Tween-20 , pH 7 . 5 ) for 1 hr . at 4\u00b0C with 10 r . p . m . end-over-end rotation . Concurrently , 16 \u00b5L 30 mg/mL Dynabeads Protein A ( Invitrogen ) was washed with 2\u00d7500 \u00b5L phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , collected by a Magnetic Particle Separator ( PureBiotech , Middlesex , NJ ) , and incubated with 3 . 6 \u00b5g 9E10 anti-myc antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) in 250 \u00b5L binding buffer for 30 min . at room temp . with 10 r . p . m . end-over-end rotation . Next , the solution of PrPSc and PrP-myc was added to the bead-anti-myc complexes , and rotated for 1 hr . at 4\u00b0C . Following this incubation , beads were collected , and supernatant was aspirated . Beads were rinsed in 4\u00d7500 \u00b5L wash buffer ( 50 mM tris , 200 mM NaCl , 0 . 05% Tween 20 ) , and analyzed for bound PrPSc . Signal intensities were quantified by densitometry with ImageGauge V4 . 22 ( Fujifilm ) in quant mode . Sequences encoding wild-type and polybasic domain deletion mutant ( \u0394N\u200a=\u200a\u039423\u201328; \u0394C-PBD\u200a=\u200a\u0394100\u2013109; \u0394\u0394-PBD\u200a=\u200a\u039423\u201328 \u0394100\u2013109 ) PrP were inserted in pcDNA5/FRT plasmids . These were used to express PrP from CHO cells , which was prepared as described previously [29] . For hamster experiments , homologous deletion mutants were used ( \u039423\u201328 , \u0394101\u2013110 , or \u0394\u0394 ) . Reactions were prepared and carried out as described by Geoghegan et al . [29] . Briefly , CHO-expressed mouse PrP ( wild-type or polybasic domain deletion mutant ) was mixed with Prnp0/0 ( Zurich ) brain homogenate ( 2 . 5% final concentration ) . Ninety microliters of this reconstituted substrate was mixed with 10 \u00b5L seed . Reactions were initially seeded with 0 . 1% scrapie-infected brain homogenate ( mouse strain RML ) in PBS , with 10 \u00b5L of product used to seed the subsequent round . \u0394C-PrPSc seed was produced by 16 rounds of sPMCA ( 1016-fold dilution of original wild-type scrapie seed ) , containing <1 original PrPSc molecule [8] . Unseeded reactions were given 10 \u00b5L PBS as initial seed . For reactions lacking cofactor , buffer ( PBS 1% Triton X-100 ) replaced Prnp0/0 brain homogenate . Each PMCA round consisted of incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 hr . with 20 sec . microplate horn sonication at 85% power every 30 min . One set of seeded samples was not subjected to PMCA ( round 0 ) , while another set was not subjected to protease digestion ( \u2212PK ) to observe input PrP . For hamster sPMCA experiments , or Sc237 strain was used , CHO HaPrP was supplemented with 20 \u00b5g/mL synthetic poly ( A ) RNA ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , and PrPSc was detected by immunoblot after 50 \u00b5g/mL digestion for 60 min . Brain homogenate sPMCA experiments were adapted from Castilla et al . [30] . 90 \u00b5L 10% CD-1 mouse brain ( Biochemed , Winchester , VA ) homogenate was prepared in PBS , 1% Triton X-100 , 5 mM EDTA , Roche Complete mini protease inhibitor , then seeded with PrPSc ( 10 \u00b5L of round 16 product ) . One round of PMCA consisted of 30 sec . 90% power microplate horn sonication pulses every 30 min . for 24 hr . at 37\u00b0C . 10 \u00b5L of each reaction product was transferred to fresh brain homogenate for the following round . Mouse PrPSc was detected by digestion with 25 \u00b5g/mL proteinase K ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) for 30 min . at 37\u00b0C and 750 r . p . m . shaking , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) , transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) , and Western detection with anti-PrP and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse sheep IgG ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) . Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) ( SuperSignal West Femto Substrate , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and visualized by a Fuji ( Fujifilm ) LAS-3000 chemiluminescence documentation system . Hamster PrPSc was detected with 50 \u00b5g/mL proteinase K for 60 min . Experiments detecting only wild-type PrP used 6D11 anti-PrP antibody . Because the central polybasic domain ( C-PBD ) forms part of the 6D11 epitope , and therefore \u0394C PrP is not detected by 6D11 ( data not shown ) , reconstituted sPMCA experiments utilized anti-PrP mAb 27/33 . RML PrPSc , propagated with CHO wild-type or \u0394C- PrPC in vitro by sPMCA ( Figures 1B , S4 ) for at least 14 rounds , was diluted 1\u223610 in diluent ( PBS+1 mg/mL BSA ) . \u0394N- and \u0394\u0394-PrPSc molecules , propagated from \u0394C-PrPSc ( Figure 2B ) , were prepared in the same manner . By serial dilution , each inoculum contained 10\u221215 of the original seed , equivalent to less than one original PrPSc molecule [8] . PrPSc preparations ( 30 \u00b5L ) were injected intracerebrally into female CD-1 mice aged 6 weeks ( Charles River Laboratories , Wilmington , MA ) . For two samples ( \u0394C-PrPSc and \u0394\u0394-PrPSc ) , end-point dilution bioassays were performed , in which 10-fold serial dilutions were inoculated to measure the amount of prion infectivity present in the original sample . As described previously [11] , animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of neurological dysfunction over the standard one-year observation period . Animals showing terminal scrapie were sacrificed , and their brains were analyzed for PrPSc ( by 25 \u00b5g/mL protease digestion and immunoblot ) and for spongiform degeneration ( by hematoxylin & eosin histology ) [11] . Random asymptomatic animals were sacrificed after one year , and their brains were likewise analyzed for PrPSc and spongiform degeneration . All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice , as defined by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health . The Dartmouth College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the animal work ( assurance number A3259-01 ) . Inoculations were performed under isoflurane anesthesia , and all efforts were made to minimize suffering .\nStudies using fragments of PrP identified N-terminal ( 23\u201328 ) and central ( 100\u2013109 in mouse ) polybasic domains as potential binding sites for PrPSc [14] , [16] . To investigate the role of these domains in the context of full-length PrPC , we developed a novel magnet-based assay to examine direct interaction between PrPSc and PrPC molecules with or without deletions of these polybasic regions . In this assay , PrPSc was incubated with purified recombinant myc-tagged PrP , and then adherent molecules were pulled down by \u03b1-myc antibodies attached to Protein A magnetic beads . Substitution of a short myc epitope in place of the C-terminal glycophosphatidylinositol anchor of PrPC permitted specific capture . The assay specifically assesses PrPSc binding to PrP ( Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1 ) , and indicates that purified PrPSc binds to purified PrP ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1 ) . Next , we compared binding of PrPSc to wild-type and mutant PrP substrates . In contrast to quantitative RML PrPSc binding by wild-type PrP ( \u223c100% by densitometry ) , PrP lacking the central polybasic domain ( \u0394C ) bound significantly less PrPSc ( \u223c50% ) and N-terminal polybasic deletion mutant PrP ( \u0394N ) bound still less PrPSc ( \u223c20% ) ( Figure 1A ) . Purified PrPSc also adhered to wild-type PrP more strongly than to polybasic mutant PrP ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1 ) . These results suggest that both PrP polybasic domains contribute to PrPSc binding . To test the function of PrPC polybasic domains in prion propagation , we performed sPMCA experiments with wild type and mutant PrPC substrate . These PrPC molecules , prepared from CHO cells transfected with wild-type or mutant Prnp DNA , were detergent-soluble ( Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1 ) and membrane-anchored ( Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1 ) , indicative of proper folding and intracellular trafficking . In reconstituted , three-round sPMCA experiments with PrPC and Prnp0/0 brain homogenate , PrPSc propagated efficiently , converting the PrPC to protease-resistant autocatalytic PrPSc molecules ( Figure 1B and S5 in Supporting Information S1 ) . In contrast , PrPC molecules missing one ( \u0394N , \u0394C ) or both ( \u0394\u0394 ) polybasic domains did not support efficient propagation , indicating that PrPC requires these domains to facilitate PrPSc propagation . This result was also found with Sc237 hamster prions , as we observed no propagation of protease-resistant PrP with polybasic mutant hamster PrPC ( Figure S5 in Supporting Information S1 ) . When we examined propagation in polybasic mutant substrates beyond three rounds , surprisingly , one mutant ( \u0394C ) reproducibly produced PrPSc molecules , typically between rounds 3\u20135 ( Figure 1B ) . Further , these \u0394C-PrPSc molecules propagated robustly and indefinitely ( Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1 ) , indicating capability of PrPC to support propagation despite absence of the central polybasic domain . Indeed , \u0394C-PrP conversion was extremely efficient , with \u223c100% of substrate converted to PrPSc , outpacing even wild-type PrP conversion ratios ( \u223c20% of substrate ) . \u0394C-PrPSc molecules appear to derive from the original wild-type PrPSc seed , as unseeded reactions did not generate PrPSc ( Figure 1B ) . The unexpected generation of \u0394C-PrPSc molecules led us to conduct a series of experiments to assess the role of polybasic domains in \u0394C-PrPSc propagation . Using the magnetic myc-capture assay , we tested binding to various PrP substrates . In contrast to wild-type PrPSc , \u0394C-PrPSc reproducibly bound more strongly to \u0394C-PrP ( \u223c50% of input ) than to wild type PrP ( \u223c35% of input ) ( Figure 2A ) . Furthermore , \u0394C-PrPSc bound to \u0394N-PrP ( \u223c30% of input ) , suggesting a significantly different interaction mechanism than wild-type PrPSc . Interestingly , wild-type PrPSc-PrPC binding appeared stronger than \u0394C-PBD mutant PrPSc-PrPC interactions . We next examined \u0394C-PrPSc propagation with other polybasic mutant substrates . Fitting with its binding behavior , \u0394C-PrPSc propagated successfully in \u0394N-PrPC ( Figure 2B ) . Moreover , the \u0394C-PrPSc seed also propagated in \u0394\u0394-PrPC with robust conversion , indicating that presence of a polybasic domain is not an absolute requirement for PrPC to convert to a protease-resistant autocatalytic form . Indeed , all three types of \u0394PBD-PrPSc molecules propagated robustly , with stringent proteinase K digestion ( 25 \u00b5g/mL ) revealing a protease-resistant core with a \u223c7 kDa molecular weight shift . Infectious wild-type PrPSc molecules depend on accessory cofactor molecules for propagation [11] , [12] , [31] . We tested whether polybasic domain mutant PrPSc molecules exhibit this characteristic by performing parallel sPMCA reactions , omitting the supplemental Prnp0/0 brain homogenate from one set ( Figure 3 ) . All three PrPSc mutants ( \u0394C , \u0394N , and \u0394\u0394 ) failed to propagate in the absence of Prnp0/0 brain homogenate , pointing to a cofactor-dependent propagation mechanism . The signals seen in initial rounds of cofactor-negative propagation are likely due to the presence of residual Prnp0/0 brain homogenate carried over from the PrPSc seed mixture . By the third round of sPMCA in cofactor-free substrate , no PrPSc molecules were detected . Infectious PrPSc seeds propagation in wild-type brain homogenate [32] , [33] to the extent that successful sPMCA propagation is considered potentially diagnostic for prion infectivity [9] . We tested if \u0394PBD-PrPSc molecules could seed propagation in wild-type brain homogenate ( Figure 4 ) . Like wild-type PrPSc , all three PrPSc polybasic mutants ( \u0394C , \u0394N , and \u0394\u0394 ) seeded serial propagation with success . Each of these reactions displayed positive conversion signals in round 1 , suggesting a high amount of prion infectivity [34] . Interestingly , the PrPSc molecules that formed were predominantly diglycosylated , whereas PrPSc molecules formed from wild-type seeds displayed the three glycoforms in equivalent amounts . It has been shown that the ability to produce different PrPSc glycoforms is not due to preferential interaction , but rather inherent conformation [35] . This study found that mouse RML prions only require unglycosylated PrPC for propagation , and that glycosylated forms of PrPSc can be made in its presence . This suggests that the observed glycosylation pattern described here may be caused by a different fold in polybasic mutant PrPSc . Thus , all three PBD mutant PrPSc molecules share the hallmark biochemical characteristics of infectious wild-type PrPSc molecules [11]: ( 1 ) a highly protease-resistant core , ( 2 ) cofactor-dependent propagation , and ( 3 ) the ability to seed wild-type brain homogenate sPMCA reactions . We tested whether mutant PrPSc molecules , generated in vitro from CHO-expressed PrP , are infectious to animals . Following sPMCA propagation sufficient to dilute out original seeds , wild-type and mutant ( \u0394C , \u0394N , and \u0394\u0394 ) PrPSc molecules were inoculated intracerebrally into wild-type mice . Wild-type CHO PrPSc contains significant infectivity , causing scrapie disease in all animals with an incubation period comparable to RML prions propagated in vitro in brain homogenate [36] ( Table 1 ) . Affected animals displayed accumulation of protease-resistant prion protein and significant histopathological spongiform degeneration ( Figure 5 ) , as we previously reported for hamster prions propagated in vitro in wild-type CHO-expressed hamster PrP [29] . Animals inoculated with wild-type CHO PrPSc also showed robust levels of protease-resistant PrPSc on Western blot . In contrast to wild-type , polybasic mutant PrPSc molecules show diminished in vivo infectivity . \u0394C-PrPSc caused scrapie disease only in a fraction of animals , including those receiving the most concentrated inocula , with an incubation time 2 . 5-fold greater than animals inoculated with wild-type PrPSc . \u0394C-PrPSc-inoculated diseased animals showed mild vacuolation ( Figures 5B and S7 in Supporting Information S1 ) and displayed low levels of PrPSc on Western blot , with diglycosylated molecules most abundant . Such a glycoform ratio contrasts with the even distribution of glycoforms in animals inoculated with wild-type PrPSc ( Figures 5A and S8 in Supporting Information S1 ) , also seen with in vitro propagation ( Figure 4 ) . Both wild-type and \u0394C-PrPSc induced scrapie illness characterized neurologically by lethargy and ataxia . \u0394N-PrPSc molecules induced scrapie illness in a single animal , following a 564-day incubation period ( Figure S9 in Supporting Information S1 ) , with other such inoculated animals showing no scrapie illness ( Figure 5 ) . Due to the sudden nature of some deaths , we did not obtain tissue from all animals , but brain samples from many non-scrapie deaths were obtained as indicated in Table 1 . \u0394\u0394-PrPSc molecules did not induce scrapie illness , as gauged by clinical observation and lack of protease-resistant PrP or histopathological change in animals sacrificed over one year after inoculation ( Figure 5 ) . Thus , while polybasic deletion mutant PrPSc molecules recapitulated in vitro many characteristics of infectious PrPSc molecules , they displayed low specific infectivity in wild-type mice .\nStudies of PrP fragments have indicated that polybasic domains can interact with PrPSc [14] , [16] . To investigate both prion binding and conversion in the context of the entire PrP molecule , we designed mutant prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains , which were detergent-soluble and properly trafficked , as determined by PI-PLC release . Using a novel magnetic capture assay , we found that both PrPC polybasic domains were required for optimal PrPSc binding . In reconstituted sPMCA experiments with PrP expressed and prepared from CHO cells , deletion of either or both polybasic domains of substrate PrPC prevented efficient propagation of wild-type PrPSc . As mutants lacking either domain did not efficiently bind or propagate wild-type PrPSc , both PrPC polybasic domains appear required to contact PrPSc for efficient propagation of wild-type prions . Work using N2a cells co-expressing wild-type and mutant PrP suggested that the N-terminal polybasic domain may not play a role in conversion [27] . However , the presence of endogenous wild-type PrPC may have provided conditions that facilitated conversion of the weaker-binding mutant PrP substrate . The results presented in this paper , using mutant substrate alone to test binding and propagation , suggest that the PrPC N-terminal polybasic domain indeed participates in wild-type PrPSc binding and propagation . When sPMCA reactions seeded with wild-type prions were carried out to 3\u20135 rounds , \u0394C-PrPC substrate molecules converted to a form resistant to protease digestion under stringent conditions ( 25 \u00b5g/mL proteinase K at 37\u00b0C ) . After protease digestion , this form displayed a classical shift in molecular weight of \u223c7 kDa . This form was also autocatalytic , continuing to propagate robustly ( \u223c100% conversion ) and indefinitely in \u0394C-PrPC substrate . In seeking to understand the surprising kinetics of the initial conversion event , which occurred after four rounds and 10\u22124 dilution of the original seed , we found that unseeded control reactions did not generate the mutant PrPSc product . Thus , \u0394C-PrPSc did not arise de novo [11] , but may have emerged from amplification of a few molecules of a minority conformation present in the original PrPSc seed . Such an event is consistent with recent reports of multiple prion strains emerging from a single \u201cpure\u201d source [37] , [38] , and 4\u20135 serial amplification rounds are required to detect PrPSc conformers at very low concentrations [34] . Once formed , the novel \u0394C-PrPSc molecules bound to and propagated in \u0394N-PrPC and \u0394\u0394-PrPC substrates , forming new PrPSc molecules lacking either one or both polybasic domains . Thus , in contrast to wild-type PrPSc , \u0394C-PrPSc is universally catalytic in polybasic mutant PrPC , exhibiting an expanded substrate range that points to an alternative docking mechanism during propagation . Each of the \u0394PBD PrPSc species propagated robustly , including even the mutant lacking both polybasic domains ( \u0394\u0394 ) . While wild-type PrPSc propagates by binding to substrate polybasic domains , \u0394PBD mutant PrPSc molecules appear to utilize a different mechanism to bind PrPC , as outlined by the model in Figure 6 . This indicates that prion docking , and perhaps other events in conversion , do not necessarily follow a rigidly conserved mechanism . In contrast , self-replicating fungal prions appear to utilize a stereotypic mechanism requiring glutamine/asparagine repeats [39] . The expanded interaction range of mutant PrPSc molecules could be explained by the exposure of a neoepitope on mutant PrPSc ( Figure 6 ) . If \u0394PBD mutant PrPSc molecules propagate from a minority constituent conformer within wild-type PrPSc , the putative neoepitope may also be present on these minority seed molecules . Mechanisms of PrPSc docking may also vary between different natural prion strains . Further studies are required to assess binding-site heterogeneity of PrPSc-PrPC interactions , including identification of specific docking sites used by \u0394\u0394-PBD molecules . We also observed that \u0394C-PrPSc molecules , once formed , catalyzed nearly complete conversion of autologous substrate , \u223c5-fold greater than wild-type PrPSc autocatalysis . Thus , \u0394C-PrPSc molecules show robust catalytic activity in terms of both substrate range and prion protein converting efficiency . Our biochemical analysis revealed that \u0394PBD PrPSc mutants possess all of the biochemical hallmarks that characterize wild-type infectious prions . All three \u0394PBD PrPSc mutants ( \u0394C , \u0394N , and \u0394\u0394 ) drive conversion of PrPC in wild-type brain homogenate sPMCA experiments , a model of the conversion event in prion pathogenesis [8] . Furthermore , \u0394PBD PrPSc molecules are resistant to stringent protease digestion , demonstrating a post-digestion molecular weight shift that is characteristic of PrPSc . \u0394PBD PrPSc molecules are also autocatalytic , propagating indefinitely in autologous PrPC substrate . The propagation of \u0394PBD PrPSc requires an accessory cofactor provided by Prnp0/0 brain homogenate . Thus , unlike some fungal protein conformations , which have been shown to propagate in vitro with only the alternatively folded substrate protein [40] , [41] , [42] , [43] , \u0394PBD PrPSc behaves like infectious mammalian prions in requiring a supplementary cofactor for propagation [11] , [12] , [31] , [44] , [45] . PrPSc table-1-captionmolecules generated from CHO-expressed wild-type PrPC induced scrapie illness in wild-type mice with a 100% attack rate ( scrapie incubation time\u200a=\u200a180\u00b111 days ) . In contrast , despite exhibiting the in vitro hallmarks of wild-type infectious PrPSc as described above , mutant \u0394C-PrPSc and \u0394N-PrPSc molecules showed low infectivity in vivo ( \u22643000 LD50 units/mL and \u223c300 LD50 units/mL , respectively ) , and \u0394\u0394-PrPSc showed no infectivity . Some inoculum-host PrP sequence N-terminal differences can mildly prolong scrapie incubation time , but these did not alter attack rates [46] , [47] , and much larger N-terminal PrPSc deletions than the \u0394N-PrPSc that we report here did not significantly affect incubation time or attack rate in wild-type animals [23] . For example , protease-digested PrPSc yields PrP27-30 , which is highly infectious to wild-type animals despite lacking amino acids 23\u201388 [48] , [49] . Given that \u0394PBD PrPSc molecules drive robust propagation in vitro in wild-type brain homogenate sPMCA , their diminished biological infectivity was highly unexpected , and represents dissociation between in vitro catalysis and in vivo infectivity , most notably for \u0394N-PBD and \u0394\u0394-PBD PrPSc . To our knowledge , this report is the first demonstration of absent or minimal infectivity in samples that successfully seed propagation of wild-type brain homogenate during sPMCA , suggesting that the normal route of PrPC/PrPSc interaction through polybasic domains may be required for generating infectious prions . Why might appropriate PBD-mediated interaction be required for infectivity ? One possibility is that PBD-deficient PrPSc molecules may be more susceptible to existing host mechanisms for prion clearance [50] , [51] , [52] , [53] , perhaps by exposure of a neoepitope on PrPSc that serves as a clearance signal . If this explanation were correct , then all three PBD-deficient PrPSc molecules must be preferential targets for the clearance mechanism . A more plausible explanation is that the non-PBD mediated interaction mechanisms used by \u0394PBD-PrPSc molecules to propagate in vitro lead to the production of alternative PrPSc conformations that are intrinsically non-infectious or have reduced infectivity . Consistent with this explanation , we observed different PrPSc glycosylation patterns in animals inoculated with \u0394C-PrPSc compared to animals inoculated with wild-type PrPSc . Such a distinction could be caused by an altered ability of mutant PrPSc to interact with non-PrP host molecules during in vivo propagation . For example , the in vitro detergent micelle environment differs from the membrane environments where propagation occurs in vivo . On the other hand , high titers of strain-preserved prion infectivity are propagated in vitro in detergent micelles [8] , [11] , [32] , suggesting that in vitro propagation recapitulates native events fairly well . Finally , it should be emphasized that although mutant PrPSc molecules were used in this study to uncover the dissociation between seeding ability and infectivity , the results are directly relevant to the mechanisms responsible for forming naturally occurring prions because normal wild type brain homogenates and normal wild type mice were used in sPMCA seeding assays and in vivo bioassays , respectively . The contrast between highly infectious wild type PrPSc and minimally infectious \u0394PBD-PrPSc molecules provides a novel paradigm that can be used to determine the specific structural basis of prion infectivity .", "prediction": "C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc C-PrPSc", "reference": "Prions are unconventional infectious agents that cause fatal diseases in humans and other animals . Previous studies have suggested that prion infectivity depends upon the ability of a sample to change the shape of a normal brain protein called the prion protein ( PrP ) into a disease-associated shape . Other studies have identified a pair of positively charged domains within the structure of PrP that appear to be important for the interaction between the normal and disease-associated shapes of the prion protein . In this report , we show that the shape of normal PrP can change into the disease-associated form through a novel mechanism that does not involve positively charged domains . However , it appears that interaction through the positively charged domains is required to produce infectious prions efficiently . Our results show for the first time that the ability to change the shape of normal PrP into its disease-associated state is not the sole determinant of prion infectivity ."}

Recent outbreaks , including Haiti and Yemen , are reminders that cholera is still a global health concern . Cholera outbreaks can rapidly induce high death tolls by overwhelming the capacity of health facilities , especially in remote areas or areas of civil unrest . Recent studies demonstrated that stool specimens preserved on filter paper facilitate molecular analysis of Vibrio cholerae in resource limited settings . Specimens preserved in a rapid , low-cost , safe and sustainable manner for sequencing provides previously unavailable data about circulating cholera strains . This may ultimately contribute new information to shape public policy response on cholera control and elimination . Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) recovered close to a complete sequence of the V . cholerae O1 genome with satisfactory genome coverage from stool specimens enriched in alkaline peptone water ( APW ) and V . cholerae culture isolates , both spotted on filter paper . The minimum concentration of V . cholerae DNA sufficient to produce quality genomic information was 0 . 02 ng/\u03bcL . The genomic data confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest , including cholera toxin and pilus loci . WGS identified a variety of diarrheal pathogens from APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper , highlighting the potential for this technique to explore the gut microbiome , potentially identifying co-infections , which may impact the severity of disease . WGS demonstrated that these specimens fit within the current global cholera phylogenetic tree , identifying the strains as the 7th pandemic El Tor . WGS results allowed for mapping of short reads from APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers . This provided valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information on V . cholerae strains from remote , low-resource settings . These results identified the presence of co-infecting pathogens while providing rare insight into the specific V . cholerae strains causing outbreaks in cholera-endemic areas .\nGlobal estimates for moderate to severe diarrhea are estimated to account for 1 . 6 million deaths annually worldwide and total a burden close to 75 million disability-adjusted life years ( DALY ) with costs approximating 3 . 11 billion USD in 2010 [1] . Recent studies have demonstrated the value of whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) in understanding the molecular evolution and transmission of the etiologic agents that cause moderate to severe diarrhea , including Vibrio cholerae . An analysis of > 700 V . cholerae isolate genomes originating from Asia , Africa , Latin America and the Caribbean spanning a period of more than half a century demonstrated that epidemics of cholera in Africa and the Americas stem from the introduction of a single pandemic lineage from Africa and South Asia [2] . This understanding of cholera was only possible because WGS data provided phylogenetically robust measures of relatedness . This analysis revealed that the currently circulating seventh pandemic of cholera can largely be attributed to a closely related genetic sublineage known as the seventh pandemic El Tor lineage ( 7PET ) that forms a single branch within the diverse V . cholerae species phylogeny . Over the past 20 years , WGS has improved our understanding of the molecular evolution and transmission of the etiologic agents that cause moderate to severe diarrhea , including V . cholerae [3] . Molecular epidemiology has become critical to determine the areas at highest risk for infections , to improve intervention measures such as vaccination campaigns but also to inform the development of new vaccines targeting the appropriate species and genotypes [4\u20136] . In addition , molecular epidemiological data also provides the information needed to combat the growing threats posed by antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) spread [7] . Molecular epidemiology has played an important role in recent years for cholera . The OCV stockpile was created in 2013 and the need to target the doses available to those at greatest risk is important due to limits in vaccine availability[8\u201310] . Cholera often strikes in remote or resource-poor settings where laboratory capacity is limited , and therefore , it is not always possible to culture specimens from stool . Moreover , the time necessary from specimen collection to isolate preservation can take up to five days , if culture capability is available on site , and up to several weeks if specimens have to be stored on Cary Blair and subsequently transported to a central facility . In addition , specimen storage facilities are not available in every laboratory , and biosafety shipping of infectious strains to specialized genotyping laboratories may be very challenging from cholera-affected countries . Hence , the need for alternative approaches is critical to facilitate access to genomic information from samples collected in all cholera outbreak areas , particularly remote and resource-poor areas . The primary analysis in this paper is based upon samples collected during a cholera surveillance and response program in the remote area of the Far North Region in Cameroon ( FNC ) , which established and validated the use of dried filter paper for stool specimen preservation [11] . During an outbreak in the fall of 2014 , cholera cases were primarily reported from an island in Lake Chad where specimen preservation is generally not possible due to lack of laboratory capacity and lack of cold chain transport . After prior stool enrichment in alkaline peptone water ( APW ) , the enriched specimens were either directly spotted onto filter paper ( APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper ) or cultured overnight , from which a single colony was picked and spotted onto filter paper ( culture isolate spotted filter paper ) . The dried spot methodology , with or without prior culture step , was instrumental in providing the ability to preserve genomic material in order to characterize the outbreak . The study demonstrated that dried specimen spotted filter papers can be stored for up to 2 years at room temperature prior to DNA extraction and PCR amplification [12] . Once extracted , the DNA was analysed using multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis ( MLVA ) and demonstrated that advanced molecular DNA methods could be used on dried specimen spotted filter papers preserved samples [12] . A similar study was performed in 2012 during a cholera epidemic in Sierra Leone , where watery diarrhea was directly sampled on filter paper without prior enrichment in APW , and stored for nearly three years at room temperature before successful MLVA genotyping [13] . Given the limitations of MLVA in providing detailed high-resolution molecular epidemiological features , we sought to determine if the same spotted filter paper material could also be used to perform WGS . This is a proof of principle study demonstrating that DNA extracted from simple , low-cost , APW-enriched and culture isolate spotted filter paper can generate high-quality accurate sequence data that has the potential to inform public health decisions by providing essential information on cholera genotype and co-infection burden .\nAPW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers included in the study were isolated from participants enrolled in the \u201cSustainable Cholera Surveillance for Cameroon\u201d project . The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved this study , IRB No . IRB00003981 . Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or their caretaker prior to initiation of study activities . The surveillance methodology , specimen collection , laboratory testing and findings have been previously reported [11 , 12] . Sixty-five isolates from two distinct outbreaks in the Far North of Cameroon were collected during this time . Cameroonian stool specimens from 65 patients tested positive for V . cholerae by Crystal VCTM dipstick kit ( Arkray Healthcare Pvt Ltd . , Surat , India ) and subsequently culture-confirmed . Of these specimens , only 16 were processed according to two different protocols , called hereafter APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper and culture isolate spotted filter paper . The specimens referred to as APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers are derived from stool samples enriched for 6-hours in 1X alkaline peptone water ( APW ) solution at room temperature . Two drops of the APW-enriched stool specimen were aliquoted onto two circles of a Whatman 903 filter paper card for preservation [12] . The specimens referred to as culture isolate spotted filter paper refers to the same 16 Cameroonian patients\u2019 specimens from which an isolate was able to be cultured . Briefly , the APW-enriched stool specimen was transferred via Cary Blair media to the main health facility for microbiological culture . The specimen was streaked onto TCBS medium overnight at 37\u00b0C . From each TCBS culture , a single colony was selected , diluted in 50\u03bcL of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and aliquoted onto filter paper . To evaluate spotted filter paper as a new sample preservation method , the viability of V . cholerae after drying on filter paper blots was tested . V . cholerae serogroup O1 was grown in liquid culture to a confluence of 1x108CFU/mL; 50\u03bcL of bacterial suspension was aliquoted onto Whatman filter paper and allowed to air dry overnight at room temperature ( 17h ) . Simultaneously , bacterial suspensions were aliquoted into 4 tubes for Vibrio viability experiments: heat-killing , ethanol-killing , bleach-killing and UV-light irradiation were evaluated for their sterilisation potential . After timed incubations with each potential killing agent , the bacterial suspension was spotted onto filter papers and allowed to air-dry overnight . A dried spot was excised from each filter paper and subsequently incubated in APW for 6 hours at 37\u00b0C . Following enrichment , specimens were tested via Crystal VC dipstick to assess for any V . cholerae growth . Concurrently , each specimen was streaked on both TCBS and Luria Agar ( LA ) plates for overnight culture . For APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers , a single spot of filter paper was excised at Johns Hopkins facilities , using scissors and inserted into a micro-centrifuge tube , washed twice with 1ml 1X PBS , and boiled with 200\u03bcL 1 . 5% Chelex solution for eight minutes . After a 1-minute centrifugation , the supernatant was transferred to a sterile micro-centrifuge tube . The presence of V . cholerae was confirmed via multiplex PCRs , first targeting an outer membrane protein , OmpW , in combination with primers targeting cholera toxin A , ctxA . A second PCR confirmed the presence of the rfb gene specific for the O1 serogroup following previously described methods [14 , 15] . To optimize for WGS following Chelex extraction , the DNA extracted from culture isolate spotted filter papers was subsequently purified by ethanol precipitation as described by Sambrook et al . [16] . The DNA was resuspended with ddH2O and sent for quantification by Qubit 2 . 0 Fluorometer ( Thermofisher ) and qPCR ( StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System ) before WGS . Only samples with greater than a 0 . 001 ng/\u03bcL\u03bcl concentration of V . cholerae DNA were submitted for WGS . WGS was performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to generate 100 bp paired-end reads . Short read data are available in the European Nucleotide Archive ( ENA ) database ( S3 Table ) . Sequence reads were mapped against reference genome V . cholerae O1 El Tor reference N16961 ( accession numbers LT907989/LT907990 ) using SMALT v0 . 7 . 4 [17] . SMALT was used to index the reference using a k-mer size of 13 and a step size of 6 ( -k 13 -s 6 ) and the reads were aligned using default parameters but with the maximum insert size ( i ) set as 3 times the mean fragment size of the sequencing library . PCR duplicate reads were identified using Picard v1 . 92 [18] and flagged as duplicates . A reference-based alignment was obtained by mapping paired-end Illumina reads to DNA sequenced from APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers and isolate spotted filter papers to the V . cholerae O1 El Tor reference N16961 . Automated annotation was performed using PROKKA v1 . 11 [19] and a genus-specific database from RefSeq [20] . Variation detection was performed using SamtoolsMpileup v0 . 1 . 19 [21] with parameters \u201c-d 1000 -DSugBf\u201d and bcftools v0 . 1 . 19 [22] to produce a BCF file of all variant sites . All bases were filtered to remove those with uncertainty in the base call . The bcftools variant quality score was required to be greater than 50 and the mapping quality to be greater than 30 . If all reads did not give the same base call , the allele frequency , as calculated by bcftools , was required to be either 0 for bases called the same as the reference , or 1 for bases called as a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) ( af1 < 0 . 95 ) . The majority base call was required to be present in at least 75% of reads mapping at the base , ( ratio < 0 . 75 ) , and the minimum mapping depth required was 4 reads , at least two of which had to map to each strand ( depth < 4 , depth_strand< 2 ) . Finally , strand bias was required to be less than 0 . 001 , map bias less than 0 . 001 and tail bias less than 0 . 001 . If any of these filters were not met , the base was called as uncertain . A pseudo-genome was constructed by substituting the base call at each site ( variant and non-variant ) in the BCF file into the reference genome and any site called as uncertain was substituted with an N . Insertions with respect to the reference genome were ignored and deletions with respect to the reference genome were filled with N\u2019s in the pseudo-genome to keep it aligned and the same length as the reference genome used for read mapping . Mapping was visualised with Artemis [23] and ACT [24] . Short reads from the Cameroonian samples were assembled de novo using SPAdes v3 . 10 . 0 [25] , reordered against the reference sequence with ABACAS [26] , and then a metaSPAdes [27] was performed with parameters\u2014meta -t 8 -m 15 . Statistics from assemblies were extracted with metaQUAST with parameters\u2014fast -no-check [28] . Genome completeness estimates and checks for contamination were performed using CheckM lineage wf with the following parameters -t 8 -x fa\u2014reduced tree [29] . Kraken v0 . 10 . 6 [30] was used to assign taxonomic labels using default parameters and the database Refseq release 72 ( 27/08/2015 ) . Annotation was performed using the RAST server [31] . A genome distance matrix was obtained by using MASH on SPAdes assemblies as previously described [32][5] . To accurately place our samples into a phylogenetic context , we supplemented our analyses with previously published genomes taken from Weill et al [2] . A Neighbor-Joining tree was generated based on the distance matrix using MASHtree [33] . An outgroup composed of M66 , CNRVC960188 and CNRVC961190 was used to reroot the tree using Figtree . The resulting phylogenetic tree and corresponding metadata were visualized using Microreact [34] .\nViability tests demonstrated that there was no viable V . cholerae after drying spotted filter paper overnight ( 17h ) , Viability was negative on all specimens evaluated via overnight culture on both TCBS and Luria Agar . This demonstrated that the specimens were no longer infectious for V . cholerae allowing safe shipping regarding biological risks . Sixteen V . cholerae O1 positive specimen pairs were included in this study , comparing APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper to culture isolate spotted filter paper , both derived from the same original stool specimen . As measured by RT PCR , total DNA concentration was on average 3 times higher when recovered from APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper than from culture isolate spotted filter paper . Conversely the concentration of V . cholerae specific DNA was nearly 2 . 5 times higher from the culture isolate spotted filter paper compared to the APW-enriched specimen spotted on filter paper , as per the median and the mean reported in Table 1 . In both cases , the quantity of DNA was sufficient to perform WGS ( Table 1 ) . Only two APW-enriched specimen spotted samples , 600064 and 600068 , displayed higher V . cholerae DNA concentration than their respective culture isolate counterpart . The mapping coverage for all samples ranged from 8 . 8x to 500x with an average of 128 . 4x ( Fig 1A ) . The percentage of V . cholerae N16961 reference genome covered by reads ranged from 19 . 71% to 98 . 33% with an average of 68 . 44% ( Fig 1B ) . In both APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers and culture isolate spotted filter papers , Spearman correlation test showed a positive correlation between the quantity of V . cholerae DNA and the percentage of V . cholerae genome covered by short reads in DNA extracted from both APW-enriched and culture isolate spotted filter papers ( Spearman correlation score = 0 . 42 , p < 0 . 1 ) ( S2 Fig ) . A minimum concentration of 0 . 02 ng/\u03bcL of V . cholerae specific DNA in the sample generated more than 75% coverage when mapped against the reference genome . 43% of all spotted filter papers that showed successful mapping contained a concentration of V . cholerae DNA greater than 0 . 02 ng/\u03bcL . The percentage of the reference genome mapped appeared to plateau between a concentration of 0 . 2 and 0 . 3 ng/\u03bcL . When comparing the mapping data according to the sample preparation protocol used , APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers generated slightly higher mapping quality scores , specifically 148 . 7 \u00b1144 . 03 mean depth and 70 . 52% \u00b126 . 81 reference genome covered compared to 105 . 86 \u00b181 . 4 mean depth and 66 . 14% \u00b125 . 52 reference genome covered for isolate spotted filter papers ( Fig 1 ) . The two protocols , APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter paper were not statistically significant ( Wilcoxon rank test , p-value = 0 . 5518 and p-value = 0 . 1965 for mean depth and reference genome covered respectively ) . De novo assemblies using SPAdes produced assemblies with < 1000 contigs for 13 out of 16 isolate DNA samples and 6 out of the 16 APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers . The best assembly with less than 100 contigs including some contigs larger than 50000bp and covering more than 97% of the genome was obtained from DNA extracted from the APW- enriched specimen spotted filter paper for specimen 600057 ( Table S3 ) . APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper exhibited larger contigs than culture isolate spotted filter paper assemblies ( Fig 2A ) . The range in results was higher for the APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers compared to the culture isolate spotted filter paper , as illustrated by the wide range of reference genome fraction covered by the assemblies of APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers , varying from 0 . 007% to 97% ( Fig 2B ) . MetaSPAde generated assemblies for 15 of the 16 APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers and 16 out of 16 culture isolate spotted filter papers , while SPAde only produced 24 assemblies out of 32 samples . One APW-enriched specimen sample , 500291 , did not produce an assembly from either MetaSPAde analysis or SPAde analysis , likely due to limitations in the quantity of cholera-specific DNA available in the specimen . MetaSPAde analysis of APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers allowed for the identification of the V . cholerae genome through sequence assemblies in a higher proportion of samples compared to culture isolate spotted filter papers . Preliminary species diversity analyses of both APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers and culture isolate spotted filter papers showed that V . cholerae reads represented one of the most abundant species in the majority of the samples ( S3 Fig ) . Metagenomic analysis of APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper showed the presence of a diverse microbial population ( S3 Fig ) . As an example , bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family such as various Shigella species or Escherichia coli strains , in addition to V . cholerae infection were identified in APW-enriched spotted filter papers . The use of MetaSPAde and MetaQUAST software allowed us to determine with higher accuracy the specific contribution of V . cholerae genome to the assemblies as well as the extent of bacterial diversity found in these samples ( Fig 3 ) . As expected , genomic diversity appears higher in enriched specimen spotted filter papers compared to culture isolate spotted filter papers . Similarly , V . cholerae genome is present in higher proportion in enriched specimen spotted filter papers compared to culture isolate spotted filter papers , which can be easily explained due to the lower quantity of DNA present in the isolate spotted filter papers ( Fig 3 ) . Of the 32 APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers samples sequenced , 20 failed to provide coverage above 50% or generate assemblies of greater than 1000 contigs . Therefore , these samples did not meet the criteria for further analysis and were excluded . Assemblies from both the APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers samples of the same patient were simultaneously aligned with the V . cholerae reference genome N16961 . Alignment comparison demonstrated that assemblies of all APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers contained contigs outside of the V . cholerae genome and include sequences that show a high degree of similarity with other bacterial genomes ( Fig 3 ) . The substantial level of coverage facilitated the alignment of short reads to V . cholerae O1 reference genome , confirming the molecular epidemiological characterization of these strains as V . cholerae O1 . Further , several biologically relevant genes and genomic features of the V . cholerae genome could be identified in APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers as well as in culture isolate spotted filter papers . Such examples of genes are ctxA and ctxB cholera toxin-encoded genes embedded into the integrated CTX\u03a6 prophage; and tcpA , a gene of the Vibrio pathogenicity island . The strains were not part of O139 serogroup , demonstrated by the absence of genes including rstA , or wfbA of the rfb region ( Fig 1C and S4 Fig ) [35\u201338][35\u201338][34\u201337] . Variant calling was performed following SMALT mapping in order to identify single nucleotide variant sites ( SNV ) and sequence diversity within the V . cholerae genomes of each sample . Variant calling was not performed in samples with a DNA concentration below 0 . 02 ng/\u03bcL ( S5A Fig ) . Compiling all analyses , the highest quality samples were selected based on assembly criteria such as V . cholerae genome fraction covered ( > 50% ) , number of contigs ( > 100 ) , largest contig ( > 5000 ) , total assembly length ( > 2 . 2Mb ) and NG50 > 500 ( S3 Table ) . Genome distance subsequently estimated using MASH on the eight best spade assemblies of this study were analysed in the context of sequences published by Weill et al . representing V . cholerae samples spanning over the past century [2] . This data was clustered using a Neighbour-Joining tree demonstrating the characteristic waves reflective of the global phylogeny of the 7th pandemic as shown in ( Fig 4 ) and https://microreact . org/project/S1OfV91PG . The phylogenetic analysis confirmed the affiliation of the Cameroonian V . cholerae strains extracted from APW-enriched and culture isolate spotted filter papers to the 7th pandemic El Tor . Importantly , the samples fit within the third wave of the global phylogenetic tree of V . cholerae , in close proximity to other Cameroonian samples of recent years such as those dated from 2005 , and from 2010 and 2011 . Based on these observations , we have concluded that the following quality criteria need to be fulfilled for correct phylogenetic interpretation , namely a proportion of reference genome covering greater than 50% , a mean depth greater than 20x , V . cholerae DNA concentration greater than 0 . 02 ng/\u03bcL , and examination of assemblies ( NG50 ) .\nIn this study , we successfully sequenced DNA from two types of samples spotted onto filter papers for preservation . Not only were these preservation methods proven safe but effective for WGS quality standards after collection , storage and transport . DNA was recovered from all Cameroonian spotted filter papers and WGS proved to be successful for all samples despite low quantity of DNA recovered . WGS results allowed for mapping short reads for the majority of APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers and all but one of the culture isolate spotted filter papers . Despite high heterogeneity , the quality of the mapping for APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers , when compared to culture isolate spotted filter papers , proved to be of variable but satisfactory quality . Quality was illustrated by several criteria including mean depth , proportion of reference genome covered , DNA concentration , and NG50 . Mapping confirmed the identification of specific virulence genes and the absence of genes implicated in important biological pathways of V . cholerae , providing critical molecular epidemiological information to characterize cholera outbreaks in remote and/or unstable areas [39\u201341][38\u201340][39\u201341][35\u201337] . Furthermore , successful assemblies obtained from WGS of these samples were instrumental in identifying gene context and gene organisation within reconstituted genomes . Analyses suggested that the use of APW enrichment of stool rather than the more laborious selection of isolate spotted filter paper might be more efficient for reconstitution of V . cholerae assemblies . This data provides a source of information to develop informed experimental hypotheses that may reveal new biological mechanisms of V . cholerae bacteria . The use of metagenomics software tools showed bacterial diversity in V . cholerae infected samples and highlighted the prospect for using spotted filter paper for routine metagenomics analysis . This finding highlights the presence of co-occurrences of potential gut bacterial colonisation or co-infection with other diarrheal pathogens . Novel biological interaction mechanisms may also be explored at the bacterial population level , such as the complexity of the gut microbiota in cholera infected patients [42] . Extracting DNA from APW-enriched specimen spotted filter papers revealed the potential for studying multiple bacterial populations through WGS . The ability to study the diversity of bacterial populations from spotted filter papers will facilitate the study and understanding of the microbiome in low-resource settings , not only as it pertains to cholera . Mapping based on quality criteria such as the proportion of reference genome covered , mean depth , original concentration of DNA , and high-quality assembly criteria such as NG50 , number and size of contigs allowed us to restrict our analysis to high quality assemblies only . This high-quality assembly data could be used to understand the genetic distance between V . cholerae strains and place the analyzed sample within a general phylogenetic context in the global history of cholera transmission . Pairwise mutation distance-based clustering results confirmed the low level of diversity expected in V . cholerae clinical samples of an epidemic outbreak . Phylogeny is a critical tool that has been proven to contribute to characterizing outbreaks and to provide evidence for global and local transmission . This tool will be of specific value in remote and resource-constrained settings such as regions where cholera is endemic or regions with elevated risk of cholera epidemics . It will facilitate testing and verification of experimental hypotheses related to the biology of V . cholerae in controlled laboratory settings where the opportunity may not be otherwise possible . This is a result of difficulties in specimen processing and preservation in remote and austere settings where cholera is often endemic . However , with the increasing affordability of sequencing and the recent development of affordable and compact sequencing technologies , such as ISeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION , access to these technologies in countries at high-risk for cholera is increasing . Together the use of dried specimens in combination with more affordable resources in country may facilitate informed decision-making for a timely response to cholera outbreaks in remote and low-resource areas . There are several areas of improvement to be considered in future studies . First , since sequencing was not the original intention of the specimen preservation , we did not preserve non-enriched/direct stool samples on the filter paper . Currently , we are working to collect crude , APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers in tandem to facilitate the comparison of DNA quality as well as sequence results across all potential specimen preservation types to optimize the method most applicable in a low resource setting . Second , the DNA extraction method is an important limitation in the comparison of APW-enriched versus isolate filter paper sequences in this paper . The use of ethanol precipitation likely greatly reduced the final DNA concentration available for sequencing from the isolate spotted filter paper , therefore a direct extraction comparison is warranted . Efforts are currently underway to actively improve the quality and quantity of DNA extracted from filter paper cards through protocol refinement for all specimen types . Subsequent to this study , we have also employed duplicated spotting of specimens at all of our study sites as it has shown to be advantageous providing additional specimen available at minimal cost for these advanced molecular studies . Finally , the wide array of filter paper technologies available will present options for further consideration to determine the specific type of filter paper best for use in subsequent work to optimize DNA preservation on filter paper . In conclusion , we present a proof of concept for WGS of DNA extracted from APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers specifically targeted , but not limited , to V . cholerae strains preserved on dried filter papers . We have determined the minimum methodological requirements allowing for successful WGS that would allow for the retrieval of biologically relevant genomic information . Until sequencing is widely accessible and affordable , the optimization of this method provides high-level molecular information at low cost and limited difficulty to countries at-risk . In conjunction with new sequencing technologies that may soon be available in low-resource settings , we may soon understand transmission patterns in-real time rather than post-outbreak characterization . The optimization of filter paper preservation for WGS will pave the way towards a better understanding of V . cholerae transmission and outbreak dynamics globally .", "prediction": "Global estimates for Vibrio cholera annually approximate 4 million cases worldwide with 95 million cases", "reference": "Cholera affects more than 4 million people globally every year; people predominantly living in poverty or in resource-constrained conditions including political crises or natural disasters . Cholera\u2019s typical presentation is characterized by rapid onset of acute watery diarrhea and vomiting which can progress from watery stool to shock in as little as four hours . Laboratory conditions needed for culture confirmation and strain preservation are rarely to never present in these affected areas . In fact , many cholera endemic areas in Sub-Saharan African are so remote that even treatment response alone is often challenging . Here we present the genomic analysis of DNA extracted from dried filter paper , which is a low-cost , low-tech and sustainable method . Previously this method has facilitated cholera confirmation by PCR , but we demonstrate that this method is also suitable for whole genome sequencing and subsequent strain characterization by presenting the analysis of samples from an outbreak in a remote area of Cameroon . This method will facilitate the understanding of the molecular epidemiology in cholera-prone areas , which were previously too challenging to attempt . It also introduces a method that can be used on a broader scale for diarrheal disease surveillance , including providing a window into co-infection and microbiome analyses ."}

Animal learning may therefore be seen more as the process of selecting among , and adapting , potential behavioral policies , rather than mere strengthening of associative links . Calcium influx through high-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is central to synaptic plasticity , and altered expression of Cav1 . 2 channels and the CACNA1C gene have been associated with severe learning deficits and psychiatric disorders . Given this , we were interested in how specifically a selective functional ablation of the Cacna1c gene would modulate the learning process . Using a detailed , individual-level analysis of learning on an operant cue discrimination task in terms of behavioral strategies , combined with Bayesian selection among computational models estimated from the empirical data , we show that a Cacna1c knockout does not impair learning in general but has a much more specific effect: the majority of Cacna1c knockout mice still managed to increase reward feedback across trials but did so by adapting an outcome-based strategy , while the majority of matched controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule . Our results thus point to a quite specific role of a single gene in learning and highlight that much more mechanistic insight could be gained by examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies . The results may also have clinical implications for treating psychiatric disorders .\nThe ability to learn , to adapt one\u2019s own behavior in order to optimize positive and avoid negative feedback , is central to all living beings . Animals like humans are constantly seeking to infer the ( causal ) structure of their environment and to predict the outcomes of their actions [1 , 2] , sometimes to a degree that \u201csuperstitial beliefs\u201d about environmental contingencies may form [3] . However , since the environment is only partially observable , with an often infinite or exponentially exploding space of possibilities , inferring the optimal course of actions is , in general , a computationally intractable problem [4] . Hence , animals like humans rely on heuristics , strategies , and ecological biases that favor certain types of environmental contingencies over others and narrow down the search space [5 , 6] . For instance , rodents are predisposed to employ ecologically sensible strategies like win-stay , lose-shift , or alternate [7\u20139] , and these behaviors are also more readily acquired [10 , 11] . Moreover , recent evidence suggests that animal learning , even on apparently simple conditioning tasks , may often engage active , evidence-driven choices among behavioral strategies , rather than mere passive strengthening of stimulus-response ( SR ) associations [12 , 13] . The upshot here is that animal learning may rely on a large variety of different previously acquired or predisposed strategies , rather than on a uniform mechanism , like SR strengthening , that could either be enabled or disabled . Given this larger repertoire of potential a priori strategies and heuristics with which animals may enter any given experimental task context , there may be more than one way for increasing reward [14 , 15] , even though this may not have been experimentally intended . In such situations , more conventional analysis in terms of error counts or reaction times compared among experimental groups may perhaps ( wrongly ) infer that one group is simply diminished in its learning abilities compared to another , while the observed differences may actually be rooted in the different behavioral strategies applied . Individual differences in learning strategies have recently been approached within the framework of computational reinforcement learning ( RL ) and decision-making theories [e . g . , 16 , 17] , which have been applied , for instance , to disentangle model-free and model-based forms of learning and their distinct neural substrates [18\u201320] or to reveal strategic interactions during ( model-based ) sequential planning [21] . Building on ideas like these , we show here how a genetic variation may determine an animal\u2019s learning strategy and associated performance patterns . Specifically , we studied learning in terms of behavioral strategies on a 2-choice operant cue discrimination task in 2 groups of mice , a group with a genetic modification associated with severe learning deficits [22] , namely , a selective knockout ( KO ) of the Cacna1c gene coding for the \u03b1 subunit of Cav1 . 2 L-type high-voltage-dependent calcium channels ( Cav1 . 2NesCre ) , and matched controls with intact gene expression ( Cav1 . 2fl/fl ) . Calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels is essential for synaptic plasticity and other cellular adaptations [23] thought to underlie instrumental learning [24] . The CACNA1C gene has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disease [22 , 25] , rendering it an important target for understanding learning mechanisms not only in normal but also psychiatric conditions . By studying the detailed pattern of behavioral responses and rewards received across the learning process , combined with analyses based on behavioral ( reinforcement ) learning models , we found that Cav1 . 2NesCre mice did not simply exhibit a general learning deficit but rather relied on different behavioral strategies than Cav1 . 2fl/fl mice .\nTo examine potential learning deficits caused by selective ablation of the Cav1 . 2 L-type calcium channel subunit , a cue discrimination task consisting of 3 different task phases was set up ( Fig 1 ) . The basic task required animals to perform a nose poke response on one side of a touchscreen box if a light square came up in the upper central position of the screen and to the other side if the stimulus was shown in the lower position ( Fig 1I ) . Hence , the animals had to associate cue location ( top , bottom ) with response side ( left , right ) for a maximum of reward returns ( correct responses according to this \u201ccue rule\u201d were always rewarded ) . In task phase I , trials with the cue in top or bottom position occurred in a pseudorandom order ( see Materials and methods for details ) , but correction trials consisting of repetitions of the unsuccessful trial were run after each wrong ( nonrewarded ) response . In task phase II , \u201cslightly ambiguous\u201d trials with reduced stimulus contrast were introduced , i . e . , with cues appearing in both positions but the one indicating the correct response side brighter than the other ( Fig 1II ) . In phase III , \u201cfully ambiguous\u201d trials were added with cues in both positions with the same brightness ( responses to both sides were rewarded in this case [Fig 1III] ) . Also , in phases II and III , trials which required animals to perform responses to the side opposite to the one rewarded in the previous trial ( termed \u201cshift trials\u201d here ) were always followed by 1\u20132 trials in which the cue indicated the side rewarded in the previous trial ( \u201cstay trials\u201d ) ( see Materials and methods and S1 Fig for details ) . As detailed below , these manipulations in phases II and III served as additional probes for the behavioral strategies or biases exhibited by the animals ( except for the analyses targeting specifically these trials , however , different trial types were pooled for analysis whenever possible ) . They were introduced in sequential task stages and not all at once so as to not overload the early learning phase for the animals . No significant side bias was found in either group of animals on the first day of testing , nor was there a difference in side preference between groups ( see Materials and methods ) . First , we assessed the number of correct responses according to the experimenter-defined \u201ccue rule\u201d ( Fig 2 ) . Both groups of animals , Cav1 . 2NesCre and Cav1 . 2fl/fl , displayed levels of accuracy as defined by this rule that ranged significantly above chance in all 3 task phases , as confirmed by both subject-level binomial and group-level t tests ( see Fig 2 legend for statistical details ) . This verifies that performance levels in both groups significantly increased over the course of the task , even if assessed purely in terms of the experimenter-defined cue rule . Nevertheless , a 2 \u00d7 3-factorial analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with \u201cgroup\u201d ( Cav1 . 2NesCre versus Cav1 . 2fl/fl ) as between- and \u201ctask phase\u201d as within-subjects factor revealed a main effect of group ( F ( 1 , 21 ) = 20 . 19 , p < . 001 ) , a main effect of task phase ( F ( 2 , 42 ) = 40 . 62 , p < . 001 ) , and an interaction effect ( F ( 2 , 42 ) = 18 . 7 , p < . 001 ) , indicating that performance was significantly worse for Cav1 . 2NesCre compared to Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals , in a task-phase-dependent manner , as further confirmed by post hoc tests ( Fig 2B; note that for these across-phase comparisons low- and high-contrast trials were combined in phases II & III , as these were not present in phase I , see Materials and methods and below ) . Next , we examined whether performance depended on whether the previous trial required a response to the same side for obtaining reward as the current one ( \u201cstay trial\u201d ) or a response to the opposite side ( \u201cshift trial\u201d ) . For both shift and stay trials , we again observed a main effect of group ( shift trials: F ( 1 , 21 ) = 6 . 55 , p = . 018 , stay trials: F ( 1 , 21 ) = 22 . 59 , p < . 001 ) , a main effect of task phase ( shift trials: F ( 1 . 35 , 28 . 33 ) = 11 . 12 , p = . 001 , stay trials: F ( 2 , 42 ) = 47 . 97 , p < . 001 ) , and a significant phase-by-group interaction ( shift trials: F ( 1 . 35 , 28 . 33 ) = 11 . 01 , p = . 001 , stay trials: F ( 2 , 42 ) = 3 . 54 , p = . 038 ) . While Cav1 . 2fl/fl mice essentially showed the same performance pattern across task phases in both types of trials ( i . e . , an increase from phase I to phase II , both post hoc tests p < . 001 , and no further increase in phase III , both p > . 1 ) , as they should if they acted according to the cue rule , for Cav1 . 2NesCre , the response pattern strongly differed on shift and stay trials: while , in fact , Cav1 . 2NesCre animals performed around chance level in stay trials throughout the whole first task phase before jumping to higher performance levels in phases II and III ( post hoc tests phase I versus II: p = . 033 , phase II versus III: p = . 003 , see Fig 3A ) , they demonstrated high performance on shift trials in phase I , which then , however , dramatically declined across task phases ( post hoc tests phases II versus III: p = . 001 , see Fig 3B ) . Indeed , Cav1 . 2NesCre even outperformed Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals on shift trials during phase I ( post hoc tests Cav1 . 2fl/fl versus Cav1 . 2NesCre phase I: p = . 044 ) , while Cav1 . 2fl/fl outperformed Cav1 . 2NesCre in all other conditions ( all p < . 05 ) . The fact that Cav1 . 2NesCre animals did not exceed chance level in terms of the cue rule throughout stay trials in phase I and shift trials in phase III suggests that they may not have gathered the experimentally intended cue-response association . This interpretation is further supported by a separate analysis of trials with reduced stimulus contrast ( Fig 3C ) : while Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals were significantly influenced by this manipulation , as one would expect if their behavior were controlled by the cue ( low- versus high-contrast trials , phase II: t ( 11 ) = 1 . 82 , p = . 096; phase III: t ( 11 ) = 3 . 34 , p = . 007 ) , reducing cue contrast did not affect the behavior of the Cav1 . 2NesCre animals ( low- versus high-contrast trials , phase II: t ( 10 ) = . 33 , p = . 75; phase III: t ( 10 ) = \u2013 . 21 , p = . 836 ) . The results above raise the question of how the Cav1 . 2NesCre mice did manage to improve task performance , although they apparently did not issue their responses in accordance with the presented cue . In novel environments , rodents quickly adopt and learn to adapt ecologically prepared or previously acquired strategies like win-stay or win-shift [e . g . 7 , 10 , 11] , which we will denote as \u201coutcome rules\u201d in the following , rather than extracting the ( cue-based ) rules experimentally imposed . To assess this , we first evaluated how consistent their pattern of responses is with any of the 4 elementary outcome-based strategies: win-stay , win-shift , lose-stay , and lose-shift . Fig 4A gives the relative frequency of responses across trials on each day that are consistent with a win-shift and a lose-shift rule for Cav1 . 2NesCre and Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals ( note that by symmetry , p ( win-shift ) = 1\u2013p ( win-stay ) , and p ( lose-shift ) = 1\u2013p ( lose-stay ) ) . In general , there was a main effect of ( outcome-based ) strategy ( F ( 1 , 21 ) = 78 . 03 , p < . 001 ) and task phase ( F ( 1 , 21 ) = 78 . 03 , p < . 001 ) , but the strategy depended on phase ( strategy x phase: F ( 2 , 42 ) = 47 . 06 , p < . 001 ) and was further modulated by group ( strategy x group: F ( 1 , 21 ) = 32 . 16 , p < . 001 and strategy x group x phase: F ( 2 , 42 ) = 3 . 306 , p = . 046 ) : on the one hand , outcome-strategy-conforming responses appeared to change in both groups with task phase and trial history , but on the other , this adaptation was clearly different for Cav1 . 2NesCre and Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals . Specifically , both groups favored lose-shift over lose-stay , that is , tended to shift to the other side after an unsuccessful response ( binomial tests on lose-shift against chance across all task phases: p\u2264 . 001 for 23/24 animals ) . After successful trials , however , Cav1 . 2NesCre mice considerably differed in their behavior from Cav1 . 2fl/fl: During phase I , they shifted significantly more often after wins than Cav1 . 2fl/fl ( post hoc test: p = . 001 ) and even marginally more so than after losses ( post hoc test win-shift versus lose-shift for Cav1 . 2NesCre: p = . 079 ) , thus basically increasing their overall probability for shifting ( Fig 4A left ) . Cav1 . 2fl/fl mice , in contrast , exhibited significantly more shifts after incorrect trials than after correct ones ( post hoc test win-shift versus lose-shift for Cav1 . 2fl/fl: p < . 001 ) , with no preference for win-shift over win-stay ( see Fig 4A right , p ( shift | win ) \u2248 . 5 , t ( 11 ) = \u2013 . 02 , p = . 98 ) . In phases II and III , Cav1 . 2NesCre animals then reduced shifting after correct but not incorrect responses ( post hoc tests win-shift in phase I versus II: p = . 012 , phase II versus III: p < . 001 ) . Although this general trend is similar to that shown by Cav1 . 2fl/fl ( phase I versus II and phase II versus III: p < . 001 ) , Cav1 . 2NesCre animals still win-shifted significantly more often than Cav1 . 2fl/fl in phase II ( p = . 001 ) and , by trend , in phase III ( p = . 069 ) . Thus , in essence , Cav1 . 2NesCre animals increased the overall probability for shifting during phase I and then selectively and progressively decreased their win-shift tendency in the next 2 phases ( see also S2 Fig ) . Note that the larger proportion of stay-correct trials in task phases II and III by task design ( see above and Materials and methods ) makes downregulating win-shift responses a sensible strategy . This raises the question of whether the below-chance decrease in win-shift responses observed also in Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals reflects ( partial ) adoption of a win-stay strategy or whether this decrease could partly be related to other , confounding factors , like correlations among cue and outcome rules ( overlap between cue and win-stay ( outcome ) rule: phase I: ~47% , phase II: ~74% , and phase III: ~82% ) . The ambiguous trials introduced in phase III ( with equal cue intensities in the top and bottom positions ) might help to dissociate cue- versus outcome-based rules , since , on these trials , the cue is completely noninformative with respect to response side . However , both Cav1 . 2NesCre and Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals kept on applying a win-stay strategy in these trials ( Cav1 . 2NesCre: 60% win-stay , t ( 10 ) = 2 . 80 , p = . 019 compared to chance; Cav1 . 2fl/fl: 59% , t ( 11 ) = 2 . 84 , p = . 016 ) , although Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals showed this behavior significantly less often than in other phase III trials ( t ( 11 ) = \u20136 . 16 , p < . 001 ) , while Cav1 . 2NesCre animals did not ( t ( 10 ) = \u20131 . 39 , p = . 19 ) . Cav1 . 2NesCre ( but not Cav1 . 2fl/fl ) animals also exhibited a highly significant correlation between win-stay behavior on ambiguous and nonambiguous trials across days ( Cav1 . 2NesCre: t ( 10 ) = 6 . 59 , p < . 001 , Cav1 . 2fl/fl: t ( 11 ) = . 82 , p = . 43 , and Cav1 . 2NesCre versus Cav1 . 2fl/fl: t ( 21 ) = 2 . 12 , p = . 046 ) , further supporting the idea that Cav1 . 2NesCre ( in contrast to Cav1 . 2fl/fl ) animals more generally followed an outcome rule . These observations thus suggest that , in truly ambiguous situations , Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals may also partly revert to a win-stay strategy . In situations like phase I , however , where win-staying bears no advantage over win-shifting , Cav1 . 2fl/fl ( unlike Cav1 . 2NesCre ) animals did not show any such preference but followed the more rewarding cue rule ( see above ) . While decreasing win-shifting is sensible in phases II and III given the task design , it does not explain why Cav1 . 2NesCre animals clearly adapted their outcome-based behavior over time also in phase I or why , more generally , this might be a worthwhile approach in the present task . Ultimately , one would expect animals to increase the likelihood for a certain strategy if it turned out to be more rewarding than alternatives and , in particular , compared to random responding . We therefore next examined the frequency of rewards the Cav1 . 2NesCre animals had actually received on responses consistent with each of the 4 outcome-based response options ( Fig 4B ) . Different outcome strategies were indeed associated with significantly different reward probabilities ( main effect strategy: F ( 1 , 10 ) = 457 . 7 , p < . 001 ) , and these were further modulated by task phase ( strategy x task phase interaction: F ( 1 . 29 , 12 . 86 ) = 545 . 06 , p < . 001 ) . While shifting after an incorrect trial was the most rewarding strategy ( post hoc comparison of lose-shift to all others in all phases: p < . 001 ) , reward probability for shifting versus staying after a correct trial really depended on the experimental phase: a win-shift strategy was more rewarding in phase I ( win-shift versus win-stay: p < . 001 ) and less rewarding in phases II and III ( post hoc tests both p < . 001 ) . Moreover , employing binomial tests , win-shift-consistent responses in phase I were significantly more often associated with reward than would have been expected by chance ( for all Cav1 . 2NesCre animals: p < . 001 ) . Thus , based on the actual outcomes the animals had experienced , a win-shift/lose-shift strategy should have been perceived as more rewarding than either chance responding or any alternative combination of outcome-based responses in phase I , while win-stay/lose-shift would have been the most effective combination in phases II and III , consistent with the pattern of responses Cav1 . 2NesCre animals actually displayed ( Fig 4A ) . The analyses in the previous sections showed that the actual response pattern in Cav1 . 2NesCre mice is more consistent with outcome-based rules , while that of Cav1 . 2fl/fl mice is more consistent with the cue rule , and that these strategies could have been perceived as rewarding by the animals based on the actual experiences they have had . To conclusively statistically demonstrate that outcome-based versus cue-based behavior indeed sufficiently explained the animal choices both across and within task phases , we next examined the animals\u2019 behavior in terms of bootstrap distributions and formal reinforcement learning ( RL ) models generated from the empirical data . An outcome rule bootstrap distribution was generated by having an \u201cartificial agent\u201d making choices purely based on the 4 outcome rules but with probabilities for the 4 response options ( win-stay , win-shift , lose-stay , and lose-shift ) derived from the animals\u2019 actual choice frequencies on each day . Hence , this \u201cagent\u201d would choose to win-stay , win-shift , and so on with the exact same probabilities on each day as the actual animals but would only act upon these and ignore other behavioral options or task features , like the cue . This was contrasted with an \u201cagent\u201d that acted purely based on the 4 cue-related response options ( \u201ctop-cue/left-response , \u201d \u201ctop-cue/right-response , \u201d \u201cbottom-cue/left-response , \u201d and \u201cbottom-cue/right-response\u201d ) , again with the probabilities for showing this behavior on each day instantiated by the animals\u2019 actually displayed response frequencies . By running these agents for 1 , 000 iterations of the same basic task design and phases as used for the animals , bootstrap distributions were generated consistent with a pure outcome-based or pure cue-based strategy , applied with the same probabilities actually exhibited by the animals . While 11/12 Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals escaped the outcome rule bootstrap distributions ( i . e . , performed significantly better ) in both shift ( Fig 5 ) and stay ( S3 Fig ) trials , this was only the case for 4/12 Cav1 . 2NesCre animals . Indeed , Cav1 . 2fl/fl and Cav1 . 2NesCre animals significantly differed with regards to their agreement with the outcome bootstraps ( \u03c72 = 8 . 71 , p = . 003 ) , indicating that performance in the Cav1 . 2NesCre group is much better explained in terms of adaptation of outcome-based strategies than is the case for Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals . Vice versa , when animal behavior was evaluated in terms of the cue rule bootstrap distribution , only 3/12 Cav1 . 2fl/fl , but 10/12 Cav1 . 2NesCre , animals escaped the cue rule distributions on either shift or stay trials , with , again , significant differences among the groups ( \u03c72 = 8 . 22 , p = . 004 , see S4 and S5 Figs ) . Thus , Cav1 . 2fl/fl animal behavior tended to be consistent with the cue rule but inconsistent with the outcome rules , while the reverse tended to be true for Cav1 . 2NesCre animals . As a final step to prove that the observed performance progress across trials could indeed entirely be explained by adapting outcome- versus cue-based strategies , RL models were estimated from the behavioral data ( see Materials and methods ) . In brief , these models consist of linear update rules for the values of ( situation , action ) -pairs ( Eq 1 in Materials and methods ) and a sigmoid-type choice probability function ( Eq 3 in Materials and methods ) , which renders situation-dependent choices among response options , with probabilities based on the learned relative values of the different actions in that situation . The learning process itself was modeled by a Rescorla\u2013Wagner ( RW ) rule [26] , augmented by a Pearce\u2013Hall ( PH ) -type \u201cassociability\u201d mechanism [27] , which regulates the learning rate in accordance with the recent history of reward prediction errors ( see Materials and methods for details; a pure RW model and a simplified hybrid RW+PH model with 1 rate parameter fixed were checked as well and yielded almost identical results ) . Hence , these models would progress from trial to trial , sequentially gathering evidence for the different reward returns to be expected from the different response options in each environmental situation and issuing choices on each trial based on these learned values . Two types of models were constructed , one equipped purely with the 4 elementary outcome rules ( see above; termed \u201coutcome model\u201d in the following ) , ignoring the cue or any other potential strategy , and one with the 4 cue-based response options as given above ( \u201ccue model\u201d ) , basing its choices solely on these . Thus , both models are described by exactly the same number of response options and parameters and differed solely in terms of what these response options would refer to . The set of 5 parameters that characterizes each of these models is comprised of a global learning rate \u03ba , an additional time-dependent rate component regulated by a parameter \u03b7 in accordance with the recent history of reward prediction errors , and 3 individual exploration parameters \u03b2k for each separate task phase k\u03f5{I , II , III} . While the 2 learning rate parameters \u03ba and \u03b7 determine how values for ( situation , action ) -pairs are updated as the animals progress through their individual trial sequences ( see Eq 2 in Materials and methods ) , the 3 parameters \u03b2k control the steepness of the sigmoid choice function ( Eq 3 in Materials and methods ) and , thus , how deterministically ( \u03b2\u2192\u221e ) or probabilistically ( \u03b2\u21920 ) an animal would behave given the learned values . All parameters were estimated from the animal data by maximum likelihood , and models were compared via hierarchical Bayesian inference , yielding expected posterior probabilities for the 2 types of models ( cue-based versus outcome-based ) given the observed behavioral data ( see Materials and methods for details ) . Cav1 . 2NesCre animals were much better described by the RL model , which updates the 4 elementary outcome strategies , than by the cue RL model , with the expected posterior model probabilities being p\u00af ( outcome\u00a0model|data ) = . 71 versus p\u00af ( cue\u00a0model|data ) = . 29 ( S6 Fig left ) and an exceedance probability ( i . e . , the likelihood with which the posterior model probability of the outcome model exceeds that of the cue model; see Materials and methods ) of p = . 95 ( S6 Fig right ) . By contrast , the behavior of the Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals was much better captured by the RL model updating cue-association strategies , with expected posteriors p\u00af ( cue\u00a0model|data ) = . 79 versus p\u00af ( outcome\u00a0model|data ) = . 21 and an exceedance probability for the cue over the outcome model of p = . 99 . This analysis confirms that an outcome model much more plausibly describes the behavior of the Cav1 . 2NesCre animals than a cue model , while , vice versa , the cue model agrees much better with the behavior of the Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals than the outcome model . In our study , the specific Cacna1c knockout was achieved via the Cre-lox system using a Nestin promoter-driven Cre recombinase in mice double-transgenic for both Cav1 . 2fl/fl and Nestin-Cre ( i . e . , Cav1 . 2NesCre ) . However , mice carrying the Nestin-Cre transgene alone ( NesCre ) have previously been associated with metabolic issues [28] as well as with potential deficits in learning [29] , although that same study found that the deficit was rather specific to fear conditioning ( freezing responses ) and did not carry over to other kinds of learning . Nevertheless , given these previous indications , we conducted a further control study with 12 NesCre and 12 wild-type ( WT ) mice using the exact same experimental protocol as employed before . These 2 additional controls were run on experimental phase I only , since only the first task stage is required to assess whether the animals would pick up the cue rule in principle . As done above , we then compared all groups based on percentage of correct responses , bootstrap distributions designed to assess the deviation of actual performance from the one expected under a given response rule , and RL models . All of these 3 analysis approaches consistently indicated that the additional control groups are better described in terms of the cue-based response strategy: both NesCre and WT mice show increased accuracy ( according to the cue rule ) at the end of phase I compared to Cav1 . 2NesCre mice ( ANOVA main effect on groups: F ( 3 , 44 ) = 15 . 04 , p < . 001; both post hoc tests p < . 001 , see also S7 Fig ) but were not different from the previous Cav1 . 2fl/fl control group ( both p > . 99 ) . Furthermore , only 1/12 NesCre and 0/12 WT mice left the 90% confidence bands of the cue rule bootstrap distribution , i . e . , most animals showed performance levels as expected under the cue rule . Chi-square-based tests confirmed that significantly more of the NesCre and WT animals adhered to the cue rule than Cav1 . 2NesCre knockout animals ( NesCre versus Cav1 . 2NesCre: \u03c72 = 16 . 67 , p < . 001 , WT versus Cav1 . 2NesCre: \u03c72 = 20 . 31 , p < . 001 ) , with numbers comparable to those within the original control group ( NesCre versus Cav1 . 2fl/fl: \u03c72 = 1 . 2 , p = . 273 , WT versus Cav1 . 2fl/fl: \u03c72 = 3 . 43 , p = . 064 ) . Conversely , in terms of the outcome-based response rules , 11/12 NesCre and 10/12 WT mice went beyond the confidence bands of the outcome rule bootstrap distribution , i . e . , significantly deviated from the performance expected under the outcome rule . Again , these numbers are significantly different from those in the Cav1 . 2 knockout strain ( NesCre versus Cav1 . 2NesCre: \u03c72 = 8 . 71 , p = . 003 , WT versus Cav1 . 2NesCre: \u03c72 = 6 . 17 , p = . 013 ) but not from those in the Cav1 . 2fl/fl group ( NesCre versus Cav1 . 2fl/fl: \u03c72 = 0 , p = 1 , WT versus Cav1 . 2fl/fl: \u03c72 = . 38 , p = . 537; results were similar when only task phase I was considered for all animals , see Materials and methods ) . Lastly , our RL-model-based analysis revealed that , similar to the Cav1 . 2fl/fl controls , both NesCre and WT mice have a much higher posterior probability for the cue rule model ( NesCre: p\u00af= . 929 , WT: p\u00af= . 929 ) than for the outcome rule model ( NesCre: p\u00af= . 071 , WT: p\u00af= . 071 ) . Thus , we conclude that the change in response strategy observed for the knockout strain is indeed specific to this group , that is , can be attributed to the ablation of Cav1 . 2 calcium channels and is not due to other confounding factors .\nIn a real ecological context , there is a multitude of different factors and contextual conditions that will or could influence whether a behavioral plan will ultimately lead to success . When an animal hits on a favorable outcome it had not expected , it is often difficult to discern which of the many foregoing sensory inputs and actions were indeed crucial for predicting and achieving this success and which are irrelevant and would better be ignored; also termed the \u201ccredit assignment problem\u201d [32] . To parse out the crucial and predictive factors from limited experience , the small sample of reality an animal has access to in its lifetime , would be difficult enough if the world were rather deterministic . But on top of that , the world is highly uncertain and probabilistic , full of unforeseen events that complicate inference on environmental structure . To deal with this , animals have evolved or acquired a larger repertoire of general strategies , heuristics , shortcuts , and response preferences [5 , 6] that could guide them through novel situations by biasing probability distributions toward certain subsets of situation/action/outcome triples and , potentially , are also designed to minimize an animal\u2019s cognitive effort [33] . All these different response strategies and biases almost certainly come into play in any novel laboratory situation an animal faces . Animals are unlikely to behave completely randomly but , according to recent evidence , might actually actively probe and test out different such strategies and behavioral \u201chypotheses\u201d whilst learning [12 , 13] . In rodents , common a priori strategies are win-stay , win-shift , lose-shift , or alternate [7 , 9 , 10] , which all could make sense in one environmental setting or another [8 , 11 , 34] . For instance , rats hoard food in their underground burrows\u2014once the food is gone from one of the chambers or , more generally , a food source is depleted , it is certainly reasonable to win-shift . In other circumstances , food sources may be expected to refill ( perhaps in certain temporal intervals ) , such that a win-stay strategy would be more appropriate . Hence , it seems reasonable that even the Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals in our task reverted to one of these more basic strategies , namely win-stay , when the cue information became ambiguous on certain trials . In fact , some of the Cav1 . 2fl/fl animals that did not show as high performance levels as their group mates appeared to have adopted an outcome-based strategy as well , further illustrating that this is not a behavioral pattern \u201coutside the normal scope\u201d but a sensible , although suboptimal , way to approach this task . Often , from an experimenter\u2019s point of view , it might in fact not be that easy to construct experimental situations that clearly dissociate what the experimenter intended the animals to do from one of these basic , a priori strategies animals bring into the task . For instance , to probe working memory in rodents , delayed response or alternation tasks on a T-maze are often used . However , some studies have suggested that , rather than using working or short-term memory to encode correct responses as intended by the experimental design , rodents may rely on subtle external bodily cues like head orientation maintained throughout the delay phase of the task [14 , 15] . Such behavioral alternatives or confounds with other previously acquired or prepared strategies may easily be overlooked or , indeed , sometimes hard to avoid . There could also be other hidden dependencies or predictable structure in a task design ( especially in learning tasks that evolve across trials ) that are not immediately obvious and that animals may attempt to exploit . Even if overall ( given unlimited experience ) everything is well balanced and controlled by design , the individual history of trial drawings , responses , and outcomes may be locally highly nonrandom and bias animals differentially toward certain strategies rather than others [35 , see also 36 , 37] . Thus , consideration of different possibly rewarding behavioral strategies may not only provide a lot more mechanistic insight by revealing the details of how an animal solves the task posed but may , in fact , prove important for drawing the right conclusions with respect to the involved cognitive and behavioral capacities . For these reasons , it is also important that the behavioral analysis takes the animals\u2019 perspective by taking into account the exact same set or sequence of trial types as encountered by the animals in order to accurately infer what they could have possibly learned about different behavioral policies given their individual choice and reward histories [35] . In fact , it is a particular advantage of the bootstrap- and model-based analyses reported here that they adopt the animal\u2019s point of view , incorporating the exact same sequence of stimulus events , behavioral responses , and reward returns as experienced by the animals , and thus yield day-by-day ( or even trial-to-trial ) predictions on an individual animal basis ( e . g . , Fig 5 ) . Further note that the next trial type encountered by an animal is often a consequence of the animal\u2019s own behavior , as in the case of correction trials , hence a reflection of the animal\u2019s own choices that should be acknowledged in an analysis of behavioral strategies . With regards to the specific experiments conducted here , we therefore would like to emphasize that none of the analyses made any a priori assumptions about the distribution or occurrences of trial types but went exactly with those trials as empirically observed and that , of course , the experimental conditions for all animal strains were exactly the same ( and hence all differences in experienced trial sequences a consequence of differences in the animals\u2019 behavior ) . It may also be worth noting that the animals showed strategy-consistent responses across all 3 task stages , although these considerably differed in the composition of trials and trial transitions they harbored . Our RL model analysis was based on a Rescorla\u2013Wagner rule augmented by a Pearce\u2013Hall-type mechanism [27 , 38] , in which the learning rate is regulated by the recent history of successful outcome predictions , increasing as the mismatches between predicted and experienced rewards become more numerous ( and thus indicating to the animal that its current response policies need to be altered ) . Although the results using this type of learning rule were completely consistent with those obtained with a pure Rescorla\u2013Wagner rule ( as well as with a simplified hybrid model; see Materials and methods ) , we adopted this learning mechanism , as it turned out to yield the best description of the behavioral data based on Bayesian model comparisons ( see S8 Fig ) . Animal learning has also variously been described in terms of stimulus-response versus action-outcome associations [39 , 40] . In light of this discussion , it may therefore be important to emphasize again that all animal strains studied here did indeed use the outcomes to regulate and advance their behavioral policies , i . e . , were all able to utilize the reward feedback in adjusting their behavior in a profitable manner . The specific difference between the animal strains was that the Cav1 . 2NesCre mice did not base their responses on the presented cue but on where the reward occurred on the previous trial ( i . e . , on the previous outcome ) , and the bootstrap- and model-based analyses , which specify the assumptions about the behavioral process in formal detail , confirmed that this provided a sufficient explanation for the animals\u2019 behavior . Calcium ( Ca2+ ) influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) and voltage-gated calcium channels is crucial for synaptic plasticity [24] and nuclear gene expression associated with plasticity [41] and cell survival [42] . Although there are several other sources of cellular Ca2+ influx , like NMDA or T- or N-type Ca2+ channels [43 , 44] , a cortex-wide , functional ablation of L-type Ca2+ channels through a knockout of the Cacna1c gene is therefore supposed to impair plasticity , and thus learning , in a variety of settings . Indeed , this selective knockout has been associated with deficits in spatial memory [45 , 46] and observational fear learning [47] . Although the cortex-wide lack of Cav1 . 2 in the present preparation prevents a more precise localization of the effects reported here , a recent study employing a similar touchscreen-based , two-choice stimulus discrimination task in mice revealed a specific dependence on dorsal striatum [48] , in line with earlier studies linking this region to the mediation of SR associations [39 , 49 , 50] . Interestingly , this study also involved correction trials , which may facilitate outcome-based strategies , and found that performance scores in the lesioned animals settled around similar levels as observed for the Cav1 . 2NesCre mice here , about 60%\u201365% . Although outcome-based strategies were not investigated by Delotterie and colleagues [48] , these findings could indicate that the present effects may be more specifically rooted in L-type Ca2+ channel dysfunction in dorsal striatum . Findings like these may also open new perspectives on treatment options in psychiatry . Specifically , the CACNA1C gene has been associated with severe psychiatric illnesses such as depression [51] , bipolar disorder [52] , autism [53] , and schizophrenia [51 , 54] , for which it has been listed as a risk gene [51 , 55] . The present results suggest that for modifying a patient\u2019s behavior , certain avenues , potentially resting on biologically more elementary behavioral options , may be fruitful to explore where other forms of behavioral therapy have failed . They at least suggest that a detailed scrutiny of how a patient solves a specific set of cognitive or emotional tasks , on top of standard clinical assessment , may provide valuable insights into how to best address the \u201cbehavioral malfunctioning\u201d of a patient in terms of the specific behavioral interventions and rules the therapy should focus on ( see also [56] ) . Hence , in future applications , the combination of standard cognitive test batteries with model-estimation techniques , as used here , could lead into the design of more specifically targeted , individualized behavioral therapies , on top of its potential use for diagnosis and prediction .\nAll experiments complied with regulations covering animal experimentation within the EU ( European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU ) , and were approved by German animal welfare authorities ( Regierungspraesidium Karlsruhe: ethical approval no . 35-9185-81-G-227-12 ) . All mice were bred in the animal facility of the Central Institute of Mental Health , Mannheim , Germany , and maintained on a C57BL/6N background . CNS-specific ablation of the L-type voltage gated calcium channel Cav1 . 2 was achieved by inactivation of the Cacna1c gene using the cre-loxP system . More specifically , Cav1 . 2NesCre mice ( genotype: Cav1 . 2 L2/L2 , Nestin-Cre -/+ ) were generated by crossbreeding mice carrying 2 loxP-flanked ( \u201cfloxed\u201d ) Cav1 . 2 alleles [45] and mice with an additional heterozygous transgene expressing Cre recombinase under the control of a Nestin promoter [57] . In these animals , the loss of Cav1 . 2 functionality is accomplished by the excision of Cacna1c exons coding for the IIS5 and IIS6 transmembrane segments of the pore-forming subunit \u03b11C of the Cacna1c gene via Cre recombinase that is expressed in all cell types of the CNS through embryonic development . Crossbred Cav1 . 2fl/fl mice homozygous for the floxed Cav1 . 2 allele but lacking Cre recombinase expression ( genotype: Cav1 . 2 L2/L2 , Nestin-Cre -/- ) , and thus not suffering calcium channel loss , served as primary controls within the experiment . To rule out that observed learning differences between these 2 groups were not attributable to metabolic [28] or other potential factors [29] associated with the expression of Cre recombinase in the Cav1 . 2NesCre group , we assessed performance of 2 additional control groups: animals with a heterozygous transgene expressing Cre recombinase under the control of a Nestin promoter without loxP-flanked Cav1 . 2 alleles ( NesCre; genotype: Cav1 . 2 +/+ , Nestin-Cre +/- ) and pure wild-type animals ( WT; genotype: Cav1 . 2 +/+ , Nestin-Cre -/- ) . In total , 12 male Cav1 . 2NesCre , 12 Cav1 . 2fl/fl , 12 NesCre , and 12 WT mice were single-housed in conventional macrolon cages ( Type II , 26 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 14 cm ) with sawdust ( RehofixMK-2000; Rettenmaier & S\u00f6hne , Rosenberg , Germany ) , nesting material , and free access to water . Single housing was chosen as it has been shown to be less stressful for male mice than group housing under standard maintenance conditions ( i . e . , no enrichment ) [58] . All animals were approximately 12 weeks old at experimental onset . Colony room settings included a temperature of 23\u00b12\u00b0C , relative humidity 50%\u00b1 5% , and a reversed 12 hour light\u2013dark schedule with the lights off at 7:00 AM [58 , 59] . Experiments were conducted during the dark phase , which constitutes the active phase of mice . Mice were food restricted [60] to 85%\u201390% of their initial free-feeding body weight in order to maintain a high degree of motivation during operant training . The mean initial body weight was assessed on 5 consecutive days when animals had free access to food . Body weight and health status were monitored daily prior to testing . At the start of food restriction , mice were food deprived for 1 light phase and received 2 . 0 g to 3 . 3 g food in the subsequent dark phase , depending on individual loss . Henceforth , the amount of food was adjusted in accordance with the deviation from the intended 87 . 5% of initial body weight . Touchscreen-trained mice additionally received 7 \u03bcl sweet condensed milk ( SCM; Milchmaedchen , Nestle , diluted in 1:4 tap water ) as a reward for correct responses during training . They were previously acquainted to SCM in their home cages to avoid later refusal as a reward . In order to minimize handling as a source of anxiety and to reduce stress , all mice were handled without physical restraint following the cup handling protocol described in [61] . Mice were scooped up and allowed to walk freely over the handler\u2019s open hands . Mouse touchscreen chambers ( Model 80614\u201320 , Campden Instruments Ltd . , Loughborough , Leics . , United Kingdom ) included several infrared ( IR ) light beams for movement detection , a 3 W house light for controllable illumination , and a tone generator for auditory signaling . The inner chamber consisted of black Perspex walls arranged in a trapezoid shape ( height 19 cm , width 24 respectively 6 cm , depth 17 cm ) and a metal grid floor . The longer end of the chamber was equipped with a touch-sensitive screen ( IR-detector-based ) partly covered by a 3-hole Perspex mask in order to separate the display into three equal response windows ( 7 x 7 cm ) . The lateral fields were used to detect touches , while the central field was used to display the reward-side-indicating cue . Reward cues consisted of bright gray 2 . 5 cm squares ( brightness = 70% , 85% , or 96% , hue and saturation = 0 in HSB colors ) . Correct responses triggered the display of a tone , illumination in the reward tray , and delivery of 7 \u03bcl sweet condensed milk . The reward tray ( 2 x 2 x 2 cm ) of an externally placed feeder for liquid suspensions positioned at the touchscreen-opposed end of the chamber contained another light beam detector used to count entries , start and stop latencies , and trigger initiation of the next trial . Hence , the subject was required to initiate a trial at the narrow end of the chamber , subsequently traverse to the opposed touchscreen side for response , and , finally , traverse back in order to retrieve the reward . This ensured optimal prospect to the screen and constant start conditions on each trial .", "prediction": "Calcium influx through high-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is central to synaptic plasticity , and altered expression of Cav1 .", "reference": "To deal with an uncertain and complex world , animals have developed a large repertoire of behavioral heuristics and default strategies that spring into action in unknown situations . Building on this a priori repertoire , animals may find various ways to succeed on a given behavioral task . Therefore , determining the exact behavioral strategy followed during a task may be essential for understanding the cognitive processes involved . Using computational models to analyze behavior , we examined how a genetic variation in a gene that encodes a calcium channel and has been associated with learning deficits influences the way in which animals acted on a task in which a reward was associated with a specific behavior . We found that a knockout of the relevant gene does not lead to a general learning impairment but rather led animals to adopt a behavioral strategy different from the one employed by the control animals . Specifically , knockout animals managed to increase their reward returns by basing their responses more on the previous reward location rather than on reward-indicating stimuli , like the controls did . These findings may prove useful for behavioral therapy in the context of psychiatric disorders associated with this specific gene variation ."}

Understanding the causes of this variability is a critical step towards the development of personalized treatments and improvements to existing medications . Here , we investigate sensitivity to a group of anti-neoplastic drugs that target topoisomerase II using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans . We show that wild strains of C . elegans vary in their sensitivity to these drugs , and we use an unbiased genetic approach to demonstrate that this natural variation is explained by a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase II ( TOP-2 ) . The presence of a non-polar methionine at this residue increases hydrophobic interactions between TOP-2 and its poison etoposide , as compared to a polar glutamine . We hypothesize that this stabilizing interaction results in increased genomic instability in strains that contain a methionine residue . The residue affected by this substitution is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms ( methionine in hTOPII\u03b1 and glutamine in hTOPII\u03b2 ) . We go on to show that this amino acid difference between the two human topoisomerase isoforms influences cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines . These results explain why hTOPII\u03b1 and hTOPII\u03b2 are differentially affected by various poisons and demonstrate the utility of C . elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses .\nAntineoplastic regimens used to treat cancer are often associated with poor prognoses and severe side effects . Ideally , antineoplastic regimens can be tailored to an individual patient based on various genetic markers known to be associated with drug response to maximize therapeutic effectiveness and minimize unwanted side effects . Advances in sequencing technologies over the course of the past decade promised the discovery of many genetic variants that contribute to human health . Though large-scale sequencing projects have led to the identification of many genetic variants associated with disease risk [1] , relatively few variants have been identified that contribute to clinically relevant traits such as response to antineoplastic compounds . In fact , only 71 of over 500 FDA-approved antineoplastic compounds use genetic information to affect treatment efficacy ( www . fda . gov ) . Unfortunately , the predictive power of these identified genetic variants can be inconsistent due to biases in the sampled population [2] and other key limitations of clinical genome-wide association ( GWA ) studies that attempt to link genetic variants with treatment outcomes . The major factor limiting the efficacy of these studies is sample size because it is difficult to identify large numbers of individuals exposed to the same antineoplastic regimens . This limitation is compounded when considering environmental [3 , 4] and tumor heterogeneity [5] . As a result , most variants discovered to be associated with outcomes in clinical GWA studies offer low predictive power for patient responses to treatment [6] . These limitations and others emphasize the need for novel approaches to identify variants that predict patient outcomes to antineoplastic compounds . Studies of model organisms have greatly facilitated our understanding of basic cellular processes . In recent years , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster have been used to understand the physiological effects of small molecules and repurposed as screening platforms to identify new antineoplastic compounds [7\u20139] . The ability to generate extremely large numbers of recombinant yeast facilitates the identification of genomic regions that are predictive of drug response [10 , 11] . Furthermore , the specific genes and variants within regions can be identified and functionally validated in yeast [12\u201314] . By contrast , D . melanogaster studies offer the ability to study the physiological responses to drugs in the context of multiple tissue types , but functional validation of specific genes and variants associated with drug responses has been more limited [9] . The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has the advantages of both S . cerevisiae and D . melanogaster because large cross populations can be generated to study the physiological responses to drugs in a metazoan . These attributes have made C . elegans an important model for connecting differential drug responses with genetic variants present in the species [15 , 16] . Here , we take advantage of natural genetic variation present in C . elegans to identify the genetic basis underlying susceptibility to a panel of clinically relevant antineoplastic compounds that poison the activity of topoisomerase II enzymes . The inhibition of these enzymes by topoisomerase II poisons results in the accumulation of double-stranded breaks and genome instability [17\u201319] . Topoisomerase II enzymes are targeted by antineoplastic regimens because proliferative cell populations require their enzymatic activity to relieve topological stress ahead of the replication fork [20] . Using two unbiased genetic mapping approaches , we show that divergent physiological responses to the topoisomerase II poison etoposide are determined by natural genetic variation in a C . elegans topoisomerase II enzyme . Furthermore , we show using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing that variation in a specific amino acid ( Q797M ) underlies the observed phenotypic variation in response to etoposide . This residue is conserved in humans and is one of the few differences between the putative drug-binding pockets of the two topoisomerase II isoforms ( M762 in hTOPII\u03b1 and Q778 in hTOPII\u03b2 ) . Previous structural studies on hTOPII\u03b2 implicated this glutamine residue in etoposide binding because of its proximity to the drug-binding pocket [21 , 22] . However , a study on hTOPII\u03b1 suggested that the corresponding methionine residue has no functional role in drug binding [23] . We present a mechanistic model to explain how variation at this residue underlies differential responses to etoposide and other topoisomerase II poisons . Finally , we use genome-edited human cell lines to show that this residue in hTOPII\u03b1 contributes to differential toxicity of various topoisomerase II poisons . These results demonstrate the power of using C . elegans natural genetic variation to identify mechanisms of drug susceptibility in human cells that could inform human health decisions based on genetic information .\nWe investigated etoposide sensitivity in C . elegans using a high-throughput fitness assay . In brief , animals were grown in liquid culture in presence of etoposide , and body lengths of progeny and offspring production were measured using a COPAS BIOSORT ( S1 Fig ) . In this assay , shorter body lengths are indicative of developmental delay . To identify an appropriate dose of etoposide for this assay , we performed dose-response experiments on four genetically diverged isolates of C . elegans: N2 ( Bristol ) , CB4856 ( Hawaii ) , JU258 , and DL238 . We chose 250 \u03bcM etoposide for further experiments because it was the lowest concentration at which we observed an etoposide-specific effect in all four strains tested , trait differences between the laboratory Bristol strain ( N2 ) and a wild strain from Hawaii ( CB4856 ) strains were maximized , and the median animal length was highly heritable ( S2 Fig ) . When grown in etoposide , the progeny of both the Bristol and Hawaii strains are likely developmentally delayed and therefore shorter in animal length . However , the median of the Hawaii strain is on average 60 \u03bcm ( or 31% ) shorter than progeny of the Bristol strain because they are more severely affected by etoposide . To map the genetic variants underlying this difference , we performed our high-throughput fitness assay on a panel of 265 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines ( RIAILs ) , generated between a Bristol derivative ( QX1430 ) and Hawaii [16] . We measured median animal length for each RIAIL strain grown in etoposide , and we corrected for assay-to-assay variability and effects of the drug carrier ( DMSO ) using a linear model . We used the resulting regressed median animal length trait ( referred to as animal length ) for quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) mapping . This mapping identified a major-effect QTL for etoposide resistance on chromosome II at 11 . 83 Mb ( Fig 1A ) . This QTL explained 27% of the phenotypic variance among the recombinant lines . The QTL confidence interval spans from 11 . 67 to 11 . 91 Mb on chromosome II and contains 90 genes , 68 of which contain variation between the parental strains . We next sought to validate this QTL using homozygous reciprocal near-isogenic lines ( NILs ) , which contain either the QTL confidence interval from the Bristol strain introgressed into the Hawaii strain or the interval from the Hawaii strain introgressed into the Bristol strain . NILs with the genomic interval derived from the Bristol strain have increased resistance to etoposide compared to the Hawaii strain ( S3 Fig ) . Similarly , NILs with the genomic interval derived from the Hawaii strain exhibited decreased resistance to etoposide . These results confirmed that genetic variation located on the right arm of chromosome II contributes to differential etoposide susceptibility . In the initial dose response experiments , we found that JU258 and DL238 had different responses to etoposide than the Bristol and Hawaii strains , suggesting that additional genetic variation present in the wild C . elegans population could also contribute to etoposide response . To identify this additional variation , we performed a genome-wide association ( GWA ) mapping of etoposide resistance in 138 wild C . elegans isolates . This analysis led to the identification of a QTL on the right arm of chromosome II with a peak position at 11 . 88 Mb ( Fig 1B ) . This QTL has a genomic region of interest that spans from 11 . 70 to 12 . 15 Mb for which we found no evidence of selection ( S4 Fig ) or geographic clustering of the peak QTL allele ( S5 Fig ) . In addition , this QTL overlaps with the QTL identified through linkage mapping described above . Of the 138 wild isolates assayed , including the Hawaiian strain , 46 have the alternate ( non-Bristol ) genotype at the peak position on chromosome II ( Fig 1C ) . Similar to our observations using the recombinant lines , the 46 strains that contain the alternate genotype are more sensitive to etoposide than strains containing the Bristol genotype at the QTL peak marker . We hypothesized that variation shared between the Hawaiian strain and the other 45 alternate-genotype strains contributes to etoposide sensitivity because we detected overlapping QTL , with the same direction of effect , between GWA and linkage mapping experiments . This hypothesis suggested that we could condition a fine-mapping approach on variants found in the Hawaiian strain and shared across these 45 strains . To fine-map the QTL , we focused on variants shared among wild isolates . Using data from the C . elegans whole-genome variation dataset [24] we calculated the p-value of Spearman's rho correlation coefficients between animal length and each single-nucleotide variant ( SNV ) in the QTL confidence interval ( Fig 1D ) . SNVs in only three genes , npp-3 , top-2 , and ZK930 . 5 , were highly correlated with the etoposide response ( -log10 ( p ) = 10 ) . Of these genes , the top-2 gene encodes a topoisomerase II enzyme that is homologous to the two human isoforms of topoisomerase II . We prioritized top-2 because topoisomerase II enzymes are the cellular targets for etoposide [17] . To determine if genetic variation present in the top-2 gene contributes to differential etoposide sensitivity , we performed a reciprocal hemizygosity test [14] . Prior to this test , we determined that resistance to etoposide is dominant by measuring the lengths of F1 heterozygotes from a cross between the Bristol and Hawaii strains in the presence of etoposide ( S6 Fig ) . Additionally , we tested npp-3 and top-2 deletion alleles from the Bristol genetic background and found that only loss of top-2 contributes to etoposide sensitivity ( S7 Fig ) . To more definitively show a causal connection of top-2 variation to etoposide sensitivity , we used a reciprocal hemizygosity test . First , we introgressed the top-2 ( ok1930 ) deletion allele into the Hawaiian genetic background . The Bristol/Hawaii ( \u0394top-2 ) heterozygote that contains the Bristol top-2 allele is more resistant to etoposide treatment than the Hawaii/Bristol ( \u0394top-2 ) heterozygote , which suggests that the Bristol top-2 allele underlies etoposide resistance ( Fig 2A , S8 Fig ) . The observed differences between the Hawaii/Bristol ( \u0394top-2 ) and Bristol/Hawaii ( \u0394top-2 ) heterozygotes confirmed that top-2 variation underlies differential susceptibility to etoposide . To identify genetic variants in top-2 that contribute to etoposide resistance in the Bristol strain , we focused on genomic differences between the Bristol and Hawaii strains . Based on gene expression data between the Bristol and Hawaii strains [25] , top-2 is expressed at similar levels . Therefore , we concluded that etoposide resistance in the Bristol strain is likely caused by coding variation . The C . elegans top-2 gene contains 31 SNVs across the population-wide sample of 138 wild isolates . We narrowed our search to 16 variants present in the Hawaiian strain . Two of these variants are in the 3' UTR , three are in introns , and six are synonymous variants that likely do not contribute to etoposide resistance . The remaining five variants encode for amino acid changes in the TOP-2 enzyme . Of these five variants , four were highly correlated with etoposide sensitivity in the wild isolate panel: Q797M , I1206L , Q1217A , and D1387N . Multiple-sequence alignment of TOP-2 peptides across yeast , D . melanogaster , mice , and humans revealed that I1206L , Q1217A , and D1387N are in the variable C-terminal domain ( S1 File ) . By contrast , the Q797M variant is located in the conserved DNA binding and cleavage domain [26] . Structural data from human orthologs suggest that the TOP-2 Q797 residue lies within the putative etoposide-binding pocket [21] , and the corresponding residue is a methionine ( M762 ) in the hTOPOII\u03b1 and a glutamine ( Q778 ) in hTOPOII\u03b2 [23] . Additionally , the two human isoforms differ in one other residue within the putative etoposide-binding pocket ( S800 ( \u03b1 ) , A816 ( \u03b2 ) ) . Therefore , the C . elegans glutamine-to-methionine TOP-2 variant mirrors one of two differences within the etoposide-binding pocket of the two human topoisomerase II enzyme isoforms . Crucially , hTOPOII\u03b1 forms a more stable DNA-TOPOII cleavage complex with etoposide than hTOPOII\u03b2 [27] . We hypothesized that etoposide sensitivity in both C . elegans and the human isoforms is affected by this residue . To test the effects of the Q797M variant on C . elegans response to etoposide , we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to change this residue . We replaced the glutamine residue in the Bristol strain with a methionine and the methionine residue in the Hawaii strain with a glutamine . We exposed the allele-replacement strains to etoposide and found that the methionine-containing Bristol animals were more sensitive than glutamine-containing Bristol animals ( Fig 2B ) . Conversely , the glutamine-containing Hawaii animals were more resistant to etoposide than the methionine-containing Hawaii animals ( Fig 2B ) . These results are consistent with the linkage mapping experiments because the allele-replacement strains account for approximately 25% of the phenotypic variation between the Bristol and Hawaiian strains and other loci could contribute to etoposide response . We hypothesized that the non-polar functional group attached to the glycosidic bond of etoposide contributes to increased stability of the drug-enzyme complex by forming a more stable interaction with the methionine residue than with the glutamine residue . To test this hypothesis , we simulated etoposide docking into the putative drug-binding pocket of the TOP-2 homology model generated by threading the C . elegans peptide sequence into the hTOPOII\u03b2 structure ( RMSD = 1 . 564\u00c5 , PDB:3QX3; [21] ) . Upon etoposide binding , the free energy ( \u0394G ) of the drug-binding pocket was -10 . 09 kcal/mol for TOP-2 Q797 ( Fig 3A ) and -12 . 67 kcal/mol for TOP-2 M797 ( Fig 3B ) . This result suggests that etoposide interacts more favorably with TOP-2 M797 than with TOP-2 Q797 , consistent with our results in live animals . A more favorable drug-enzyme interaction , as indicated by a more negative \u0394G , likely causes increased stability of the TOP2 cleavage complexes , which has been shown to result in a greater number of double-stranded breaks throughout the genome [28] . Therefore , we expect C . elegans strains that contain a methionine at this residue to accumulate more genomic damage when exposed to etoposide . Although we do not have direct data to support the cellular effect of the drug , we believe that increased genomic damage likely delays development and causes the progeny of exposed individuals to be shorter . Because the molecular docking simulations explain the observed physiological effects of etoposide exposure , we hypothesized that the 797 residue of TOP-2 would mediate differential interactions with additional topoisomerase II poisons based on their chemical structures . Like etoposide , teniposide , dactinomycin , and amsacrine each contain core cyclic rings that are thought to interfere with the re-ligation step of the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle through DNA interactions [17] . However , the functional groups attached to the core cyclic rings of each poison vary in their polarity and size , which could affect interactions with topoisomerase II enzymes . For example , the only difference between teniposide and etoposide is the presence of a thienyl or methyl group attached to the D-glucose derivative , respectively , but they share a similarly sized and hydrophobic functional group . We predicted that these two drugs would have comparable interactions with the TOP-2 alleles and elicit a similar physiological response . By contrast , the polar functional groups of dactinomycin likely have stronger interactions with the glutamine variant and induce increased cytotoxicity in animals that contain this allele . We quantified the physiological responses of the TOP-2 allele-replacement strains exposed to these two drugs and found that each response matched our predictions ( Fig 4 ) . Specifically , the Bristol strain is more resistant to teniposide than the Hawaiian strain and the introduction of the M797 allele into the Bristol genetic background results in increased sensitivity . Similarly , the introduction of the Q797 TOP-2 allele into the Hawaiian genetic background resulted in increased teniposide resistance . Conversely , the Hawaiian strain is more resistant to dactinomycin treatment than the Bristol strain and the introduction of the Q797 allele into the Hawaiian genetic background results in increased sensitivity . Additionally , the introduction of the M797 TOP-2 allele into the Bristol genetic background resulted in increased dactinomycin resistance . In both of these cases the difference between the parental strain and the allele swap strain resulted in significant differences in the means ( Tukey\u2019s HSD ) . However , for both dactinomycin and teniposide the allele swap strains were not significantly different from each other . These results suggest that additional drug-specific QTL may exist for these two drugs . Unlike etoposide , teniposide , or dactinomycin , the core cyclic rings of amsacrine do not have an equivalent functional group to interact with the TOP-2 797 residue , suggesting that variation at TOP-2 residue 797 will have no impact on amsacrine sensitivity . Although the Bristol and Hawaiian strains differed , we found that the Bristol and Hawaiian allele swap strains had no quantifiable difference in amsacrine response when compared to the parental strains ( Fig 4 ) and different genomic loci control response to this drug ( S9 Fig ) . These results support the hypothesis that the polarity of the putative drug-binding pocket determines the cytotoxic effects of multiple , but not all , topoisomerase II poisons . To further explore this hypothesis , we tested a drug ( XK469 ) that has preferential hTOPOII\u03b2 specificity [29] . Surprisingly , we found that the Bristol allele swap strain was more sensitive to XK469 treatment than the parental Bristol strain , and the Hawaiian allele swap strain was more resistant to XK469 treatment than the parental Hawaiian strain ( S10 Fig ) . This result indicates that an additional mechanism might contribute to XK469 specificity in human cells and underscores the importance of functional validation of specific residues that are thought to be involved in targeted drug binding . To determine if differences in the hydrophobicities of the two human topoisomerase II putative drug-binding pockets underlie etoposide sensitivity , we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and a pooled-sequencing approach to create human embryonic kidney 293 cells ( 293T ) that encode hTOPOII\u03b1 enzymes with a hTOPOII\u03b2-like drug-binding pocket . These two enzymes differ at the corresponding residue ( M762 in hTOPII\u03b1 and Q778 in hTOPII\u03b2 ) that explains phenotypic variation in the natural C . elegans population exposed to etoposide . Human 293T cells were incubated with genome-editing machinery for six hours , allowed to recover for five days , and then split into two populations for etoposide exposure or no etoposide exposure . Etoposide treatment provided a selective pressure that upon further passaging led to a greater than 160-fold enrichment of cells that contain the glutamine-edited hTOPOII\u03b1 allele as compared to populations of cells exposed to no drug ( Fig 5 ) . These results show that cells with the glutamine-edited hTOPOII\u03b1 allele are more resistant to etoposide treatment than cells with the non-edited methionine hTOPOII\u03b1 allele . Notably , the rarity of genome editing events makes it unlikely that every copy of the hTOPOII\u03b1 gene in this diploid/polyploid cell line is edited . Because we see etoposide resistance in these incompletely edited cells , hTOPOII\u03b1 dimeric complexes likely contain one edited and one wild-type copy of hTOPOII\u03b1 and do not bind etoposide as well as causing less cytotoxicity . These data confirm both our dominance test ( S6 Fig ) and the two-drug model of etoposide binding [30] in which both enzymes of the homodimer must be bound by poison to be completely inhibited . Additionally , we performed the reciprocal experiment to edit the glutamine-encoding hTOPOII\u03b2 gene to a version that encodes methionine . If the methionine hTOPOII\u03b2 allele is more sensitive to etoposide than the glutamine hTOPOII\u03b2 , we would expect to observe a depletion of methionine-edited cells upon etoposide treatment . However , because glutamine-to-methionine editing occurred in less than 1% of the cells , it was difficult to detect further reductions in methionine allele frequencies ( S1 Table ) . Overall , we demonstrate that this residue underlies variation in etoposide response in the natural C . elegans population and human cell lines edited to contain the glutamine-edited hTOPOII\u03b1 enzyme . Our C . elegans results using the genome-edited top-2 strains show that variation at this residue underlies differences in some but not all topoisomerase II poisons . We exposed the edited human cell lines to these different poisons to test this hypothesis . We found that cells containing the glutamine-edited hTOPOII\u03b1 allele are less affected by both teniposide and XK469 , as indicated by the respective 8 . 2- and 2 . 8-fold increase in edited cell frequency upon drug exposure as compared to cell populations with no drug added . These results mirror our observations that C . elegans strains with the methionine TOP-2 allele are more sensitive to these drugs . We observed moderate-to-no change in edited allele frequencies between cell populations exposed to amsacrine ( ~1 . 6-fold increase ) or dactinomycin ( ~0 . 93-fold decrease ) and those cells exposed to no-drug control conditions . These results indicate that the hTOPOII\u03b1 M762 residue does not interact with amsacrine . Our expectation was that dactinomycin would be more cytotoxic to cells that contain the glutamine hTOPOII\u03b1 allele , and therefore result in a depletion of edited cells . As mentioned above , we do not have the power to detect this depletion in response because of low CRISPR-editing efficiency . However , we did expect to see enrichment of hTOPOII\u03b2 Q778M edited cells upon exposure to dactinomycin in the reciprocal experiment . Despite this expectation , we saw no change in hTOPOII\u03b2 Q778M edited cell frequency between dactinomycin and the no drug control . Our inability to detect any enrichment of allele frequencies might result from dactinomycin having multiple cellular targets in addition to topoisomerase II [31] . Taken together , our findings testing a variety of poisons on human cell lines recapitulated the results from C . elegans .\nFew genetic markers have been identified that predict patient responses to chemotherapeutic regimens [32 , 33] . The goal of this study was to introduce new methods for the rapid and cost-effective identification of genetic variants that explain differences in chemotherapeutic response . Our approach leveraged genetic and phenotypic variation present in the model organism C . elegans to identify a single amino acid variant ( Q797M ) in the topoisomerase II enzyme that underlies differences in etoposide response . Mechanistic insights into differential etoposide binding between the glutamine or methionine alleles gave us the power to predict the physiological responses to an expanded panel of topoisomerase II poisons . These results highlight how the combination of a highly sensitive phenotyping assay with classical and quantitative genetics approaches in C . elegans can rapidly identify the mechanistic underpinnings of phenotypic variability in response to a key class of antineoplastic compounds . Our approach stands in stark contrast to previous underpowered human cell line [34] and clinical studies [35] that failed to identify any statistically significant associations between etoposide-induced cytotoxicity and genetic variation in the human population . However , the residue we identified in C . elegans does not vary in the human population [36] , suggesting that GWA studies would not have identified this variant as a marker for etoposide sensitivity . Nevertheless , this residue is one of the few differences between the putative drug-binding pockets of the two human topoisomerase II isoforms ( M762 in hTOPII\u03b1 and Q778 in hTOPII\u03b2 ) , which allowed us to investigate the molecular underpinnings of drug binding . We verified that this single amino acid change in the human topoisomerase II isoforms results in profound differences in topoisomerase II poison-induced cytotoxicity using 293T cells . Though previous hTOPOII\u03b2 structural studies have implicated this glutamine-methionine difference as functionally important for etoposide binding [21 , 22] , studies involving hTOPOII\u03b1 have argued that this residue is not involved [23] . The results presented here unequivocally show that this residue contributes to differential topoisomerase II poison-induced cytotoxicity and have important implications for targeted drug design . Although topoisomerase II poisons can bind and inhibit both hTOPOII\u03b1 and hTOPOII\u03b2 , hTOPOII\u03b1 is the cellular target of poisons in most cancers because it is expressed in proliferating cells [17] . However , recent evidence suggests that side effects associated with these treatments are caused by inhibition of hTOPOII\u03b2 in differentiated cells [37] . For example , antineoplastic treatment regimens that contain the epipodophyllotoxins ( e . g . etoposide or teniposide ) are hypothesized to increase the risk of developing secondary malignancies caused by hTOPOII\u03b2-dependent 11q23 translocations [38\u201341] . Additionally , the most severe side effects associated with treatments that contain an alternative class of topoisomerase II poisons ( anthracyclines , e . g . doxorubicin or daunorubicin ) include dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and heart failure dependent on hTOPOII\u03b2 [42\u201344] . Therefore , optimal topoisomerase II poisons will maximize interactions with hTOPOII\u03b1 to inhibit proliferating cells and minimize hTOPOII\u03b2 interactions to reduce side effects . With this goal in mind , others have identified etoposide analogues with different isoform specificities but have not determined the mechanism of specificity [45] . Our study functionally validates a key residue determining isoform specificity and is critical to the improvement of this widely administered drug class . The importance of such functional characterization is underscored by our observation that C . elegans strains and human cells with the methionine TOP-2 allele are more sensitive to XK469 , despite this drug being shown to be a \u03b2-specific poison [29] . Though XK469 has been shown to be a \u03b2-specific poison , no information regarding its drug binding pocket or the mechanism driving isoform specificity is currently known . Our results indicate that XK469 occupies a similar drug-binding pocket of TOP-2 as other topoisomerase II poisons and interacts with residue 797 . To date , no human genetic variants have been linked to topoisomerase II poison-induced cytotoxicity . Of the 291 and 279 respective SNVs in hTOPOII\u03b1 and hTOPOII\u03b2 that encode missense mutations ( S14 and S15 Tables ) found in the ExAC database [36] , some are near the highly conserved DNA-binding domains or drug-binding pockets ( S11 Fig ) , which could affect drug response . However , the extent to which these variants impact responses to topoisomerase II poisons is unknown , so functional validation is required . The approach of editing human cells and following allele frequencies via sequencing represents a scalable method to assess the functional role of these variants and avoids single-cell cloning . Importantly , differences in responses to topoisomerase II poisons might not be affected by variation in the topoisomerase II isoforms but instead mediated by variation in cellular import , metabolism , or export . Pharmacogenomic data available for many antineoplastic compounds [46 , 47] , in combination with human variation data [36] , can be used to prioritize and test variants in highly conserved regions of proteins known to be involved in these alternative processes . This biased approach focused on candidate variants is necessitated by the lack of power in clinical GWA studies and is not guaranteed to successfully connect variants to differences in drug response . For this reason , unbiased mapping approaches in model organisms combined with functional validation in genome-edited human cells will greatly expand our current understanding of how human genetic variation affects drug responses .\nAnimals were cultured at 20\u00b0C with the bacterial strain OP50 on modified nematode growth medium ( NGM ) , containing 1% agar and 0 . 7% agarose to prevent burrowing of the wild isolates . For each assay , strains were grown at least five generations with no strain entering starvation or encountering dauer-inducing conditions [48] . Wild C . elegans isolates used for genome-wide association are described previously [24 , 49] . Recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines ( RIAILs ) used for linkage mapping were constructed previously [16] . Strains constructed for this manuscript are listed in Supplemental Information . Construction of individual strains is detailed in the corresponding sections below . We used a modified version ( S1 Fig ) of the high-throughput fitness assay ( HTA ) described previously [16] . In short , strains are passaged for four generations to reduce transgenerational effects from starvation or other stresses . Strains are then bleach-synchronized and aliquoted to 96-well microtiter plates at approximately one embryo per microliter in K medium [50] . Embryos are then hatched overnight to the L1 larval stage . The following day , hatched L1 animals are fed HB101 bacterial lysate ( Pennsylvania State University Shared Fermentation Facility , State College , PA ) at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and grown to the L4 stage after two days at 20\u00b0C . Three L4 larvae are then sorted using a large-particle flow cytometer ( COPAS BIOSORT , Union Biometrica , Holliston , MA ) into microtiter plates that contain HB101 lysate at 10 mg/ml , K medium , 31 . 25 \u03bcM kanamycin , and either drug dissolved in 1% DMSO or 1% DMSO . The animals are then grown for four days at 20\u00b0C . During this time , the animals will mature to adulthood and lay embryos that encompass the next generation . Prior to the measurement of fitness parameters from the population , animals are treated with sodium azide ( 50 mM ) to straighten their bodies for more accurate length measurements . Traits that are measured by the BIOSORT include brood size and animal length ( time of flight or TOF ) . Phenotype data generated using the BIOSORT were processed using the R package easysorter , which was specifically developed for processing this type of data set [51] . Briefly , the function read_data , reads in raw phenotype data , runs a support vector machine to identify and eliminate bubbles . Next , the remove_contamination function eliminates any wells that were contaminated prior to scoring population parameters for further analysis . Contamination is assessed by visual inspection . The sumplate function is then used to generate summary statistics of the measured parameters for each animal in each well . These summary statistics include the 10th , 25th , 50th , 75th , and 90th quantiles for TOF . Measured brood sizes are normalized by the number of animals that were originally sorted into the well . After summary statistics for each well are calculated , the regress ( assay = TRUE ) function in the easysorter package is used to fit a linear model with the formula ( phenotype ~ assay ) to account for any differences between assays . Next , outliers are eliminated using the bamf_prune function . This function eliminates strain values that are greater than two times the IQR plus the 75th quantile or two times the IQR minus the 25th quantile , unless at least 5% of the strains lie outside this range . Finally , drug-specific effects are calculated using the regress ( assay = FALSE ) function from easysorter , which fits a linear model with the formula ( phenotype ~ control phenotype ) to account for any differences in population parameters present in control DMSO-only conditions . All dose-response experiments were performed on four genetically diverged strains ( Bristol , Hawaii , DL238 , and JU258 ) in technical quadruplicates prior to performing GWA and linkage mapping experiments ( S4 Table ) . Animals were assayed using the HTA , and phenotypic analysis was performed as described above . Drug concentrations for GWA and linkage mapping experiments were chosen based on two criteria\u2014an observable drug-specific effect and broad-sense heritability H2 . We aimed to use the first concentration for which a drug-specific effect with a maximum H2 was observed . Broad-sense heritability estimates were calculated using the lmer function in the lme4 package with the following model ( phenotype ~1 + ( 1|strain ) ) . Concentrations for each chemotherapeutic used in mapping experiments are; etoposide\u2014250 \u03bcM , teniposide\u2014125 \u03bcM , amsacrine\u201450 \u03bcM , dactinomycin\u201415 \u03bcM , and XK469\u20131000 \u03bcM . All topoisomerase II poisons used in this study were purchased from Sigma ( XK469 cat#X3628 , etoposide cat#E1383 , amsacrine cat#A9809 , dactinomycin cat#A1410 , and teniposide cat#SML0609 ) . A total of 265 RIAILs were phenotyped in the HTA described previously for control and etoposide conditions . The phenotype data and genotype data were entered into R and scaled to have a mean of zero and a variance of one for linkage analysis ( S5 Table ) . Quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) were detected by calculating logarithm of odds ( LOD ) scores for each marker and each trait as \u2212n ( ln ( 1\u2212r2 ) /2ln ( 10 ) ) , where r is the Pearson correlation coefficient between RIAIL genotypes at the marker and phenotype trait values [11] . The maximum LOD score for each chromosome for each trait was retained from three iterations of linkage mappings ( S6 Table ) . We randomly permuted the phenotype values of each RIAIL while maintaining correlation structure among phenotypes 1000 times to estimate significance empirically . The ratio of expected peaks to observed peaks was calculated to determine the genome-wide error rate of 5% of LOD 4 . 61 . Broad-sense heritability was calculated as the fraction of phenotypic variance explained by strain from fit of a linear mixed-model of repeat phenotypic measures of the parents and RIAILs [52] . The total variance explained by each QTL was divided by the broad-sense heritability to determine how much of the heritability is explained by each QTL . Confidence intervals were defined as the regions contained within a 1 . 5 LOD drop from the maximum LOD score . Genome-wide association ( GWA ) mapping was performed using phenotype data of 152 C . elegans isotypes ( S4 Table ) . We used the cegwas R package for association mapping [49] . This package uses the EMMA algorithm for performing association mapping and correcting for population structure [53] , which is implemented by the GWAS function in the rrBLUP package [54] . Specifically , the GWAS function in the rrBLUP package was called with the following command: rrBLUP::GWAS ( pheno = ph , geno = y , K = kin , min . MAF = 0 . 05 , n . core = 1 , P3D = FALSE , plot = FALSE ) . The kinship matrix used for association mapping was generated using a whole-genome high-quality single-nucleotide variant ( SNV ) set [24] and the A . mat function from the rrBLUP package . SNVs previously identified using RAD-seq [55] that had at least 5% minor allele frequency in the 152 isotype set were used for performing GWA mappings . Association mappings that contained at least one SNV that had a value greater than the Bonferroni-corrected value were processed further using fine mapping ( S5 Table ) . Tajima\u2019s D was calculated using the tajimas_d function in the cegwas package using default parameters ( window size = 300 SNVs , sliding window distance = 100 SNVs , outgroup = N2 ) ( S7 Table ) . Fine mapping was performed on variants from the whole-genome high-quality SNV set within a defined region of interest for all mappings that contained a significant QTL . Regions of interest surrounding a significant association were determined by simulating a QTL with 20% variance explained at every RAD-seq SNV present in 5% of the phenotyped population . We then identified the most correlated SNV for each mapping . Next , we determined the number of SNVs away from the simulated QTL SNV position that captured 95% of the most correlated SNVs . A range of 50 SNVs upstream or downstream of the peak marker captured 95% of the most significant SNVs in the simulated mappings . We therefore used a region 50 SNVs from the last SNV above the Bonferroni-corrected p-value on the left side of the peak marker and 50 SNVs from the last SNV above the Bonferroni-corrected p-value on the right side of the peak marker . The snpeff function from the cegwas package was used to identify SNVs from the whole-genome SNV set with high to moderate predicted functional effects present in a given region of interest [56] . The p-value associated with the Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient between each variant in the region of interest and the kinship-corrected phenotype used in the GWA mapping was calculated using the variant_correlation function and processed using the process_correlations function in the cegwas package ( S10 Table ) . These functions use the cor . test function in R to calculate the p-value . ClustalX was used to perform the multiple sequence alignment between various topoisomerase II orthologs ( S1 File ) . NILs were generated by crossing N2xCB4856 RIAILs to each parental genotype . For each NIL , eight crosses were performed followed by six generations of selfing to homozygose the genome . Reagents used to generate NILs are detailed in Supplemental Information . The NILs responses to 250 \u03bcM etoposide were quantified using the HTA fitness assay described above ( S8 Table ) . Dominance experiments were performed using the fluorescent reporter strain EG7952 oxTi207 [eft-3p::GFP::unc-54 3'UTR + hsp::peel-1 + NeoR + Cbr-unc-119 ( + ) ] . Hermaphrodites of N2 and CB4856 were crossed to male EG7952 reporter strain , which expresses GFP , to ensure that we could measure heterozygous cross progeny by the presence of GFP . Three GFP-positive progeny were manually transferred to a 96-well assay microtiter plate containing to 250 \u03bcM etoposide dissolved in 1% DMSO or 1% DMSO control , in addition to K medium , HB101 lysate at 10 mg/ml , and 31 . 25 \u03bcM kanamycin . Animals were grown for four days at 20\u00b0C . The phenotypes of the progeny were scored using the BIOSORT as described above ( S9 Table ) . Heterozygous progeny were computationally identified as those individuals that had fluorescence levels between the non-fluorescent and fluorescent parental strains . To perform the complementation experiments , N2 and CB4856 males were both crossed to both VC1474 top-2 ( ok1930 ) /mIn1 [mIs14 dpy-10 ( e128 ) ] and VC1505 npp-3 ( ok1900 ) /mIn1 [mIs14 dpy-10 ( e128 ) ] hermaphrodites . Three non-GFP L4 hermaphrodite progeny were manually picked into experimental wells containing either 250 \u03bcM etoposide dissolved in 1% DMSO or 1% DMSO without etoposide , in addition to HB101 lysate at 10 mg/ml , K medium , and 31 . 25 \u03bcM kanamycin . Animals were grown for four days at 20\u00b0C . The phenotypes of the progeny were scored using the BIOSORT as described above ( S10 Table ) . VC1474 top-2 ( ok1930 ) /mIn1 [mIs14 dpy-10 ( e128 ) ] was used for top-2 complementation tests . top-2 ( ok1930 ) and mIn1[mIs14 dpy-10 ( e128 ) ] were individually introgressed into CB4856 for 10 generations . Once individual crosses were completed , CB4856 mIn1 [mIs14 dpy-10 ( e128 ) ] was crossed to CB4856 top-2 ( ok1930 ) to generate ECA338 , which contains a mIn1-balanced top-2 ( ok1930 ) . oECA1003 and oECA1004 were used to verify the presence of top-2 ( ok1930 ) during crosses . To perform the reciprocal hemizygosity experiment , N2 and CB4856 males were both crossed to both VC1474 and ECA338 hermaphrodites . Three non-GFP L4 hermaphrodite progeny were manually picked into experimental wells containing either 250 \u03bcM etoposide dissolved in 1% DMSO or 1% DMSO without etoposide , in addition to HB101 lysate at 10 mg/ml , K medium , and 31 . 25 \u03bcM kanamycin . Animals were grown for four days at 20\u00b0C . The phenotypes of the progeny were scored using the BIOSORT as described above ( S11 Table ) . All allele replacement strains were generated using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering , using the co-CRISPR approach [57] with Cas9 ribonucleoprotein delivery [58] . Alt-R\u2122 crRNA and tracrRNA ( Supplemental Information ) were purchased from IDT ( Skokie , IL ) . tracrRNA ( IDT , 1072532 ) was injected at a concentration of 13 . 6 \u03bcM . The dpy-10 and the top-2 crRNAs were injected at 4 \u03bcM and 9 . 6 \u03bcM , respectively . The dpy-10 and the top-2 single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides ( ssODN ) repair templates were injected at 1 . 34 \u03bcM and 4 \u03bcM , respectively . Cas9 protein ( IDT , 1074182 ) was injected at 23 \u03bcM . To generate injection mixes , the tracrRNA and crRNAs were incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes and 10\u00b0C for 10 minutes . Next , Cas9 protein was added and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature . Finally , repair templates and nuclease-free water were added to the mixtures and loaded into pulled injection needles ( 1B100F-4 , World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , FL ) . Individual injected P0 animals were transferred to new 6 cm NGM plates approximately 18 hours after injections . Individual F1 rollers were then transferred to new 6 cm plates and allowed to generate progeny . The region surrounding the desired Q797M ( or M797Q ) edit was then amplified from F1 rollers using oECA1087 and oECA1124 . The PCR products were digested using the HpyCH4III restriction enzyme ( R0618L , New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . Differential band patterns signified successfully edited strains because the N2 Q797 , which is encoded by the CAG codon , creates an additional HpyCH4III cut site . Non-Dpy , non-Rol progeny from homozygous edited F1 animals were propagated . If no homozygous edits were obtained , heterozygous F1 progeny were propagated and screened for presence of the homozygous edits . F1 and F2 progeny were then Sanger sequenced to verify the presence of the proper edit . Allele swap strains responses to the topoisomerase II poisons were quantified using the HTA fitness assay described above ( S12 Table ) . All p-values testing the differences of strain phenotypes in the NIL , complementation , and allele-replacement experiments were performed in R using the TukeyHSD function on an anova model with the formula ( phenotype ~ strain ) . p-values of individual pairwise strain comparisons were reported . The C . elegans TOP-2 three-dimensional structure homology model was built by threading the C . elegans TOP-2 peptide to the human topoisomerase II beta structure ( PDB accession code 3QX3; 59% identity , 77% similarity ) using the Prime3 . 1 module implemented in Schrodinger software [59 , 60] . After building the model , a robust energy minimization was carried out in the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations ( OPLS ) force field . The minimized structure was subjected to MolProbity analysis , and the MolProbity score suggested with greater than 95% confidence that the minimized structure model was a good high-resolution structure [61] . Next , the Prot-Prep wizard was used to prepare the TOP-2 homology model , which fixed the hydrogen in the hydrogen bond orientations , eliminated the irrelevant torsions , fixed the missing atoms , assigned the appropriate force field charges to the atoms [62] . After preparing the structure , the glutamine 797 was mutated to various rotamers of methionine ( Q797M ) , which subsequently underwent minimization in the OPLS force field . The energy-minimized structure was used in the in silico experiments . The structure data file of etoposide ( DrugBank ID: DB00773 ) was obtained from PubMed and was subjected to ligand preparation panel of the Schrodinger software . Using the induced fit docking ( IFD ) module of Schrodinger and Suflex software , we carried out the docking of etoposide with the glutamine ( S2 File ) and methionine ( S3 File ) forms of the C . elegans TOP-2 homology model . After the docking experiments , we analyzed the docked poses of the ligands bound to the TOP-2 homology models from both docking engines . Change in free energy ( \u0394G ) and the hydrophobicity parameter were calculated using Schrodinger . Gene-editing experiments were performed in a single parallel culture experiment using human 293T cells ( ATCC ) grown in DMEM with 10% FBS . On day zero , 500 , 000 cells were seeded per well in a six-well plate format . The following day , two master mixes were prepared: a ) LT-1 transfection reagent ( Mirus ) was diluted 1:10 in Opti-MEM and incubated for five minutes; b ) a DNA mix of 500 ng Cas9-sgRNA plasmid with 250 pmol repair template oligonucleotide ( Supplemental Information ) was diluted in Opti-MEM in a final volume of 100 \u03bcL . 100 \u03bcL of the lipid mix was added to each of the DNA mixes and incubated at room temperature for 25 minutes . Following incubation , the full 200 \u03bcL volume of DNA and lipid mix was added drop-wise to the cells , and the cells were centrifuged at 1000xg for 30 min . Six hours post-transfection , the media on the cells was replaced , and the cells were passaged as needed . On day six , five million cells from each condition were pelleted to serve as an early time point for the editing efficiency , and five million cells were then passaged on the five drugs at two doses for 12 days , at which time all surviving cells were pelleted . Concentrations used for each small molecule are: etoposide\u2013 500 nM , 100 nM; amasacrine\u2013 500 nM , 100 nM; teniposide\u2013 20 nM , 4 nM; dactinomycin\u2013 4 nM , 800 pM; and XK469\u20135 \u03bcM , 1 \u03bcM . Genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets using the QIAGEN ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) Midi or Mini Kits based on the size of the cell pellet ( cat # 51183 , 51104 ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations . TOP2A and B loci were first amplified with 17 cycles of PCR using a touchdown protocol and the NEBnext 2x master mix ( New England Biolabs M0541 ) . The resulting product served as input to a second PCR , using primers that appended a sample-specific barcode and the necessary adaptors for Illumina sequencing . The resulting DNA was pooled , purified with SPRI beads ( A63880 , Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA ) , and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with a 300 nucleotide single-end read with an eight nucleotide index read . For each sample , the number of reads exactly matching the wild-type and edited TOP2A/B sequence were determined ( S13 Table ) . The numbers of reads were compared using a Fisher\u2019s exact test .", "prediction": "Many chemotherapeutic drugs are differentially effective from one patient to the next .", "reference": "The severe cytotoxic effects associated with anti-neoplastic treatment regimens make it difficult to assess the contributions of genetic variation on treatment responses in clinical settings . Therefore , we leveraged genetic diversity present in the metazoan model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic variants that contribute to differential susceptibility to a broadly administered class of anti-neoplastic compounds that poison the activity of topoisomerase II enzymes . We show that wild C . elegans isolates contain either glutamine or methionine at a highly conserved residue of the topoisomerase II ( TOP-2 ) protein and that this substitution is predictive of animal responses to the topoisomerase II poisons etoposide , teniposide , dactinomycin , and XK469 . Interestingly , the two human versions of this protein , hTOPII\u03b1 and hTOPII\u03b2 , contain a methionine or glutamine at the corresponding residue , respectively . We show that this difference between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms contributes to the differential cytotoxicity induced by these drugs . Taken together , our results highlight the power of studying the effects of natural genetic variation on drug responses in a model organism and propose methods to develop new drugs that have increased affinity for the desired hTOPII\u03b1 isoform expressed in tumor cells ."}

Such effects will likely have consequences for HIV-1 transmission and disease progression . Here we analyzed the effects that soluble egg antigen ( SEA ) from Schistosoma mansoni had on modulating HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro . We determined that SEA , specifically through kappa-5 , can potently bind to DC-SIGN and thereby blocks DC-SIGN mediated HIV-1 trans-infection ( p<0 . 05 ) whilst not interfering with cis-infection . DCs exposed to SEA whilst maturing under Th2 promoting conditions , will upon co-culture with na\u00efve T-cells induce a T-cell population that was less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection ( p<0 . 05 ) compared to DCs unexposed to SEA , whereas HIV-1 X4 virus infection was unaffected . This was not observed for DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th1 or Th1/Th2 ( Tmix ) promoting conditions . All T-cell populations induced by SEA exposed DCs demonstrate a reduced capacity to produce IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 . The infection profile of T-cells infected with HIV-1 R5 was not associated with down-modulation of CCR5 cell surface expression . We further show that DCs maturing under Tmix conditions exposed to plant recombinant omega-1 protein ( r\u03c9-1 ) , which demonstrates similar functions to natural \u03c9-1 , induced T-cell populations that were less sensitive for HIV-1 R5 infection ( p<0 . 05 ) , but not for X4 virus infection . This inhibition associated again with a reduction in IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 expression , but additionally correlated with reduced CCR5 expression . We have shown that SEA parasite antigens and more specifically r\u03c9-1 can modulate HIV-1 infectivity with the potential to influence disease course in co-infected individuals .\nHumans encounter numerous pathogens throughout their life-time , encompassing bacteria , fungi , parasites and viruses with many infections occurring concomitantly . Since CD4+ T-lymphocytes are the main cell-type infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , the immune responses mounted against the array of co-infecting pathogens will likely influence HIV-1 transmission and disease progression . Helminthic parasites such as Schistosoma mansoni ( S . mansoni ) are pertinent in this context , due to their ability to evade , dampen and skew the human immune system including the modulation of CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses . Moreover , many areas endemic for S . mansoni infection have high HIV-1 prevalence rates indicating that co-infection is likely . Cells are infected with HIV-1 through the initial binding of its trimeric gp120 envelope protein to CD4 , after which it interacts with numerous chemokine receptors , typically CCR5 or CXCR4 , and undergoes entry [1] . CCR5 using viruses ( R5 ) are those predominantly transmitted and later in disease in approximately 50% of individuals the virus switches to utilizing CXCR4 ( X4 ) as a co-receptor [2] . Following transmission the virus rapidly disseminates to lymph nodes and especially to the gut associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) . The GALT is a major reservoir for CD4+CCR5+ memory T-cells and approximately 80% of these cells are lost in the first weeks following HIV-1 infection [3 , 4] . Direct infection of cells via the CD4 molecule and co-receptors is termed cis-infection . An array of C-type lectins ( CLR ) expressed on myeloid cell lineages have been shown to successfully capture HIV-1 and pass the virus to activated CD4+ T-cells , referred to as trans-infection [5] . One such lectin known to strongly support trans-infection is dendritic cell specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin ( DC-SIGN ) which is expressed to high levels on dendritic cells ( DCs ) . This molecule has been implicated in supporting HIV-1 transmission as well as virus dissemination [5 , 6] . DC-SIGN is known to bind many glycosylated structures including a large array of pathogen antigens as well as numerous host proteins found in bodily secretions [7\u201310] . Indeed , these molecules have the capacity to interfere with HIV-1 trans-infection . CD4+ effector memory Thelper ( Th ) cells consist of three major subsets; Th1 cells induced by viral infections , Th2 cells induced by parasitic infections and Th17 cells induced by bacterial and fungal infections [11] . Remarkably , expression of HIV-1 co-receptors is not directly linked to the HIV-1 susceptibility of these cells . For instance , Th1 cells express high levels of CCR5 but also produce MIP-1\u03b1 ( CCL3 ) , MIP-1\u03b2 ( CCL4 ) and RANTES ( regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted ) ( CCL5 ) , the natural ligands for CCR5 , thereby limiting R5 infection in these cultures [12 , 13] . Contrary to this , Th2 cells express lower levels of CCR5 but due to the limited production of MIP-1\u03b1 , MIP-1\u03b2 and RANTES these cultures have been shown to be infected with HIV-1 more easily [12 , 13] . This generalized view that Th2 cells are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection than Th1 cells is no longer supported . In a review by Mariana et al . it was stated that HIV-1 susceptibility of CD4+ T-cells varied dependent on the in vitro stimulation of these cells [14] . More recent studies have correlated pathogen specific CD4+ T-cell phenotypes to HIV-1 susceptibility . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infections both result in the induction of Th1 cells [15 , 16] . However , the Mtb specific T-cells are lost early during HIV-1 infection while the CMV specific T-cells are lost later in disease [17] . This discrepancy was explained by differences in cytokine expression profiles , where Mtb specific cells possess a high IL-2 and low MIP-1\u03b2 expression pattern , the reverse phenotype was observed in CMV specific CD4+ T-cells [17] . Human papilloma virus specific CD4+ T-lymphocytes have also been shown to be lost early after HIV-1 infection [18 , 19] . Helminths , including S . mansoni , are known to skew immune responses towards a Th2 phenotype , which according to the above hypothesis would be detrimental to those individuals co-infected with HIV-1 [20 , 21] . This has led to the assumption that treating S . mansoni in co-infected individuals would be beneficial for their HIV-1 disease . Clear epidemiological evidence to-date is lacking , as treatment studies have been reporting contradictory findings [22] . A treatment program in Ethiopia found that deworming S . mansoni infected HIV-1 patients led to a decrease in viral loads [23] , whilst another study in Uganda reported the opposite [24] . Similar inconsistencies have been found for other markers associated with HIV-1 disease progression as reviewed in [21] , with only one exception . Women infected with S . haematobium and who have egg induced lesions in their genital tract were found to be at higher risk of HIV-1 infection [25 , 26] . In S . mansoni infections the eggs play a crucial role in disease as they induce lesions and skew CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses . An adult S . mansoni pair typically lay up to 300 eggs a day which migrate to the gut lumen in order to be expelled [27] . One of the best studied antigen mixtures of S . manoni is soluble egg antigen ( SEA ) which is an extract derived from homogenized eggs and consists of hundreds of proteins of which many are glycosylated [28] . SEA has accordingly been shown to bind many glycan receptors including DC-SIGN , mannose receptor ( MR ) and macrophage galactose type-lectin ( MGL ) [28 , 29] . Through binding to these receptors SEA alters the DCs response to TLR4 ligand , LPS ( lipopolysaccharide ) and TLR3 ligand PolyI:C [30] . Although , SEA itself cannot fully mature immature DC ( iDCs ) , while antigen processing is similar to LPS matured DCs [31] . Furthermore , SEA exposed DCs are known to induce Th-cell responses that are skewed towards a Th2 phenotype , even when a Th1 cell response is required [32] . Recently it has been demonstrated that omega-1 ( \u03c9-1 ) , one of SEA\u2019s main components , is able to drive Th2 cell responses [33\u201335] . Omega-1 is a member of the T2 RNase family which enters the cell through binding MR and subsequently degrades cellular mRNA and rRNA products . Both the RNase activity and the glycan group are essential for Th2 skewing [33] . Infection with either S . mansoni or HIV-1 has major implications for the host due to the longevity of infection and extent of damage these pathogens cause to the immune system . The complex pathogen interactions encountered in co-infected individuals makes it difficult to determine the effect of S . mansoni on HIV-1 infection . Consequently , our study focused on the effects of SEA on HIV-1 infection , where we specifically address whether SEA can interfere with cis- or trans-infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes as well as whether the effects exerted by SEA on DC maturation can modulate the T-cell population\u2019s susceptibility to HIV-1 infection .\nIt has been reported that SEA binds several C-type lectin receptors and competes with monomeric HIV-1 gp120 for binding [28 , 36] , but has not been tested for inhibiting HIV-1 capture and transfer . We confirmed that our derived SEA binds DC-SIGN using a DC-SIGN binding ELISA , where increasing concentrations of SEA results in a dose-dependent increase of DC-SIGN-Fc binding ( Fig 1A ) . To determine whether this interaction interferes with HIV-1 binding to DC-SIGN we performed a gp140 competition ELISA . Here DC-SIGN-Fc is incubated with SEA before addition to an ELISA plate coated with trimeric gp140 . We found that concentrations as low as 0 . 2\u03bcg/ml SEA resulted in a 50% reduction of DC-SIGN-Fc binding to gp140 ( Fig 1B ) . Since the trimeric gp140 protein closely resembles the functional HIV-1 envelope protein , this data suggests that SEA can prevent HIV-1 from interacting with DC-SIGN . We next tested whether SEA could interfere with HIV-1 cis-infection of CD4+ lymphocytes ( direct infection ) . Therefore , CD4+ enriched ( CD8+ depleted ) T-cell blasts were incubated with SEA ( 1 , 5 or 25\u03bcg/ml ) before HIV-1 SF162 ( CCR5 using virus ) or LAI ( CXCR4 using virus ) was added . Neither SF162 ( R5 ) nor LAI ( X4 ) viral outgrowth , measured as the concentration of HIV-1 capsid protein ( CA-p24 ) in the culture supernatant , was affected by the presence of SEA ( Fig 1C ) . This indicates that SEA does not interfere with HIV-1 binding to CD4 , CCR5 or CXCR4 . Additionally , the presence of SEA had no visible effect on cell counts and/or cell viability of the CD4+ enriched T-cells . Since incubating DC-SIGN-Fc with 1\u03bcg/ml SEA provided a 70% reduction in its capacity to bind gp140 ( Fig 1B ) , we pre-incubated Raji DC-SIGN cells with the same concentration to identify whether SEA can block HIV-1 trans-infection of CD4+ T-cells . Viral outgrowth of both SF162 ( R5 ) and LAI ( X4 ) was approximately 80% reduced in co-cultures where the Raji DC-SIGN cells were pre-incubated with SEA ( p<0 . 01 and p<0 . 05 , respectively ) ( Fig 1D ) . Similarly , we tested the effect of SEA on immature monocyte derived DCs ( iDCs ) and observed a significant reduction ( p<0 . 01 ) in SF162 ( R5 ) outgrowth but only when iDCs were pre-incubated with 100\u03bcg/ml SEA ( Fig 1E ) . This higher SEA concentration was likely required because iDCs express higher levels of DC-SIGN than Raji DC-SIGN cells , have multiple other CLRs capable of binding HIV-1 and have a rapid receptor turnover . Mannan , known to bind DC-SIGN and block HIV-1 trans-infection , was tested as a positive control and provided similar inhibitions ( p<0 . 001 ) . SEA consists of many molecules of which IPSE/\u03b1-1 , kappa-5 ( \u03ba5 ) and omega-1 ( \u03c9-1 ) are the major components . To determine whether any of these could be responsible for blocking HIV-1 trans-infection , SEA depleted of each product was evaluated using the gp140 competition ELISA . Depletion of \u03ba5 from SEA partially restored the binding capacity of DC-SIGN to gp140 ( p<0 . 001 ) whereas depletion of IPSE/\u03b1-1 or \u03c9-1 did not abrogate the effect ( Fig 1F ) . We next tested whether plant derived recombinant omega-1 ( r\u03c9-1 ) or recombinant \u03ba5 ( r\u03ba5 ) , which carry similar glycosylation profiling as natural derived products [37] , could bind to DC-SIGN in the standard binding ELISA assay . SEA showed a dose dependent binding to coated DC-SIGN as did r\u03ba5 , whilst r\u03c9-1 demonstrated no binding , supporting the previous finding where depletion of natural derived \u03ba5 from SEA removed DC-SIGN binding activity ( Fig 1G ) . Furthermore , when testing r\u03c9-1 and r\u03ba5 in a Raji-DC-SIGN mediated capture transfer experiment , only r\u03ba5 inhibited HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes ( p<0 . 001 ) ( Fig 1H ) . In conclusion , SEA potently binds DC-SIGN , via \u03ba5 , and prevents DC-SIGN mediated capture and transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T-lymphocytes , whilst having no effect on direct infection of CD4+ lymphocytes . Besides the direct effect of blocking HIV-1 trans-infection , SEA may also affect HIV-1 infection indirectly . SEA exposed DCs have been shown to promote the development of T-cells that are skewed towards a Th2 phenotype [32] . Since it has been shown that differentially skewed Th cell populations have variant HIV-1 infection profiles [12 , 13] , it is likely that SEA can modulate HIV-1 infection and/or replication . Here we aimed to i ) determine whether the presence of SEA during DC maturation alters the polarizing capacity resulting in a modified Th cell profile and ii ) identify whether such a modulated Th cell phenotype has an altered susceptibility for HIV-1 . We therefore established an in vitro model system where we could assess the Th cell populations , induced by DCs matured in the absence or presence of parasite products , for cytokine/chemokine production and HIV-1 infection ( Schematic shown Fig 2A ) . Here iDCs ( donor A ) were matured in Th1/Th2 mixed ( Tmix ) - , Th1- or Th2-promoting conditions ( LPS , LPS+IFN-\u03b3 or LPS+PgE2 , respectively ) either in the absence or presence of SEA . Subsequently , the matured DCs were washed , to remove the SEA , and co-cultured with na\u00efve CD4+CD45RA+ T-cells ( donor B ) and Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B ( SEB ) for 8 days resulting in memory Th cell populations with specific phenotypes . These cells were then infected with HIV-1 SF162 ( R5 ) or LAI ( X4 ) and monitored for infection over time ( Fig 2A and S1 Fig ) . In our model , Th cell populations induced by DC matured under Tmix and Th2 promoting conditions harbour on average 4 . 4% \u00b10 . 4 and 4 . 6% \u00b10 . 6 SF162+ cells , respectively , whilst Th cells induced by DCs matured under Th1 promoting conditions have a lower level of infection , 3 . 1% \u00b10 . 7 ( p = 0 . 09 , compared to Tmix cell culture ) ( Fig 2B , black symbols ) . When SEA was present during DC maturation the percentage of SF162+ T-cells was found to be similar in Tmix , Th1 and Th2 cell cultures , 3 . 5% \u00b10 . 6 , 4 . 6% \u00b10 . 9 and 2 . 8% \u00b10 . 5 , respectively ( Fig 2B , blue symbols ) . A 2-way ANOVA revealed that there is a significant interaction ( p = 0 . 041 ) between SEA and the Th cell subset infected with SF162 , meaning that SEA affects SF162 infection depending on the Th cell subset . More in depth analysis of the different groups demonstrated that a Th2 cell population induced by SEA exposed DCs have a significantly lower percentage of SF162+ T-cells than a Th2 cell population induced by SEA unexposed DCs ( p = 0 . 044 ) . In contrast , SEA exposure of DCs inducing Tmix or Th1 populations did not affect the percentage of SF162+ T-cells . No such effect was observed in LAI ( X4 ) infected Th cell populations . The percentage of LAI+ cells in Th cell cultures induced by DCs , matured under Tmix , Th1 and Th2 promoting conditions , were all found to be similar , 14 . 4% \u00b12 . 2 , 16 . 7% \u00b14 . 1 and 12 . 8% \u00b11 . 4 , respectively , in the absence of SEA or 13 . 5% \u00b12 . 1 , 17 . 8% \u00b12 . 5 and 10 . 6% \u00b12 . 4 , respectively , in the presence of SEA ( Fig 2C ) . Analysing the effect of SEA on infection of different Th cell populations using a 2-way ANOVA demonstrated no significant differences . Our data demonstrate that the addition of SEA to DCs maturing under Th2 promoting conditions result in the induction of a Th cell population with a reduced susceptibility to HIV-1 ( R5 ) infection . In order to explain the reduced SF162 ( R5 ) infection in Th2 cell cultures induced by SEA exposed DCs we characterized the cytokine/chemokine ( IFN-\u03b3 , IL-4 , IL-2 , TNF-\u03b1 , MIP-1\u03b2 ) expression profiles of the different Th cell populations . First we demonstrated that neither SF162 ( R5 ) nor LAI ( X4 ) infection alters the potential of the T-cells to produce cytokines in Tmix cells ( Fig 3A ) . Next , we determined the effect of exposing DCs to SEA on Th cell responses and found a significant reduction of IFN-\u03b3 producing T-cells in all three conditions irrespective of HIV-1 infection ( Fig 3B ) . Although IL-4 production of the T-cells remained similar , the ratio , IL-4/ IFN-\u03b3 did increase when T-cells were induced by DCs matured in the presence of SEA ( Fig 3B and S1 Table ) . Besides IFN-\u03b3 , the percentage of MIP-1\u03b2+ cells was also significantly reduced in all three T-cell populations where SEA had been present during DC maturation ( Fig 3C ) . Interestingly , when comparing the cytokine profile of the SF162 infected ( p24+ ) T-cells to the profile of the total population we found a higher percentage of IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 producing T-cells in the infected fraction ( for all three T-cell conditions ) ( Fig 3D and 3E ) . Analysing the FACS plots revealed it is mainly the percentage of MIP-1\u03b2+ and IFN-\u03b3+MIP-1\u03b2+ cells that is enhanced ( Fig 3D ) . Combining data from several donors shows a significant increase in MIP-1\u03b2+ and IFN-\u03b3+ cells in the p24+ fraction ( p<0 . 05 ) ( Fig 3F ) . This increase was not observed for IL-4 nor for any cytokine monitored in the LAI ( X4 ) infected fractions ( Fig 3E ) . However , since this increase in MIP-1\u03b2+ and IFN-\u03b3+ cells in the SF162 ( R5 ) infected fraction is found in all three T-cell populations induced by SEA exposed DCs , it is unlikely that this phenomena contributes to the altered SF162 ( R5 ) susceptibility of Th2 cell cultures induced by SEA exposed DCs . Hence , the cytokine/chemokine production of the T-cells does not explain the significant reduction in SF162 ( R5 ) infection found in Th2 cell cultures induced by DCs exposed to SEA . Nevertheless , the high percentage of MIP-1\u03b2 producing T-cells in Th1 cell cultures induced by unexposed DCs may explain the trend of reduced SF162 infection levels in this population ( p = 0 . 09 ) ( Fig 2B ) . The reduced HIV-1 infection was only observed for SF162 ( R5 ) and not for LAI ( X4 ) , suggesting that CCR5 expression levels may be altered in the Th cell populations induced by SEA exposed DCs . We determined the percentage of cells expressing CCR5 on the surface as well as the quantity of CCR5 per cell . When comparing the Th2 cell cultures induced by DCs , either exposed or unexposed to SEA , we found no difference in the percentage of cells with a high expression of CCR5 , 72% versus 76 . 6% respectively , as determined by the gate based on the marker or the amount of CCR5 expressed on each cell , geometric mean of 1365 and 1705 , respectively ( Fig 4A ) . The interesting finding that the SF162- but not LAI-infected fraction had a significantly higher percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ and MIP-1\u03b2+ T-cells than the total population ( Fig 3E ) led us to speculate that SF162 ( R5 ) infection resulted in upregulation of these cytokines through CCR5 engagement rather than the specific cell phenotype being targeted by SF162 ( R5 ) virus . To examine this possibility we added either monomeric SF162 gp120 or RANTES ( a CCR5 ligand ) to LAI ( X4 ) infected cultures and determined the percentage of IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 producing T-cells . Addition of monomeric SF162 gp120 ( 1 and 3\u03bcg/ml ) or RANTES ( 0 . 7 and 5\u03bcg/ml ) did not increase the percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ or MIP-1\u03b2+ T-cells compared to 9 . 3% and 12 . 8% found in the LAI infected fraction in the absence of these compounds ( Fig 4B and 4C ) . Our data indicates that CCR5 signalling is not the cause of heightened IFN-\u03b3+ and MIP-1\u03b2+ T-cells in the SF162+ fraction . To conclude , we found no difference in CCR5 expression between Th2 cell cultures induced by DCs , either exposed or unexposed to SEA . Furthermore , it is unlikely that signalling through CCR5 causes the increased percentage of IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 producing T-cells in the SF162 infected fraction compared to the total population . We have demonstrated that Th2 cell cultures induced with SEA exposed DCs harbour a significantly lower percentage of SF162 infected cells compared to Th2 cell cultures induced by unexposed DCs . Since the Tmix cell population is more relevant to the in vivo scenario and where Th1 and Th2 cross-talk likely resides to influence responses we were interested to follow this further . Indeed , Tmix cell culture SF162 infection levels were lower ( although not statistically significant ) when DCs were exposed to SEA ( Fig 2B ) . Since omega-1 has been described as the main Th2 skewing component of SEA we aimed to study the effect of its recombinant form ( r\u03c9-1 ) on the different cell subsets [33 , 34 , 37] . In an initial experiment we identified that the addition of r\u03c9-1 ( 3\u00b5g/ml ) in the Tmix and Th2 , but not the Th1 , setting reduced infection with SF162 virus ( S2A Fig ) . When focussing further on the Tmix population we identified that the presence of 2\u00b5g/ml or 4\u00b5g/ml , but not 1\u00b5g/ml ) , r\u03c9-1 during DC maturation resulted in Tmix cell cultures with a reduced susceptibility for SF162 ( R5 ) infection , 40% and 60% less infected , respectively ( Fig 5A ) . Moreover , the presence of r\u03c9-1 during DC maturation did not affect the induced T-cell population\u2019s susceptibility to LAI ( X4 ) virus . Plotting data from independent experiments ( n = 5 ) confirms that there is significantly less infection with SF162 ( R5 ) virus in Tmix cell cultures induced by DCs exposed to r\u03c9-1 during maturation , whilst not being observed with LAI ( X4 ) infections ( Fig 5B ) . Analysing the cytokine/chemokine profile of Tmix cell populations induced by r\u03c9-1 exposed DCs resulted in a similar pattern as observed for T-cell populations induced by SEA exposed DCs . There was a significant reduction in the percentage of IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 producing T-cells whilst the percentage of IL-4 producing cells remained unaltered ( Fig 5C ) . Based on the cytokine/chemokine profile of these cells it does not appear that r\u03c9-1 leads to enhanced Th2 skewing . What we did find was a modest , 10% reduction in the percentage T-cells with a high expression of CCR5 ( indicated by the gate based on the marker ) in Tmix cell cultures induced by r\u03c9-1 exposed DCs . Similarly , we observed a reduced level of CCR5 surface expression per cell , geometric mean of 1 , 209 versus 2 , 063 , respectively which potentially plays a role in the reduced infection with R5 virus ( Fig 5D ) . Collectively , these results indicate that \u03c9-1 is the component responsible for the reduced SF162 ( R5 ) infection observed in Th2 cell populations induced by SEA exposed DCs and that the molecule can similarly reduce infection of Tmix cells at higher concentrations .\nHelminthic parasites are known to possess immunomodulatory properties and specifically skew immune responses towards a Th2 phenotype [32] . Here we studied the effect\u2019s SEA has on modulating HIV-1 infection in vitro . Although SEA did not affect cis-infection of CD4+ enriched T-cell blasts , it efficiently blocked DC-SIGN mediated HIV-1 trans-infection through the binding of Kappa-5 to DC-SIGN . We demonstrated that exposing DCs maturing under Th2 promoting conditions to SEA induce Th cells that were less susceptible to R5 but not X4 infection and that r\u03c9-1 possessed the same activity with DCs maturing under Tmix promoting conditions . Collectively , our data demonstrates that SEA has the capacity to influence numerous mechanisms associated with HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis , suggesting that the S . mansoni infection has the potential to modulate HIV-1 infection as well as disease course . Receptive anal intercourse carries the highest high risk for HIV-1 transmission , likely due to the nature of the mucosal barrier and the immune cells residing at this site [2 , 38] . DCs will be amongst the first cells encountering HIV-1 with the potential of transferring virus to CD4+ T-lymphocytes either locally or in adjacent lymph nodes [5] . The presence of SEA in the gut wall may therefore influence trans-infection and interfere with the transmission process . Similarly , Th cell responses induced in localised lymph nodes by DCs exposed to SEA , more so \u03c9-1 , could have a phenotype that is less susceptible to infection with R5 HIV-1 , again limiting the likelihood of transmission [39] . Moreover , regardless of the route of HIV-1 infection , a massive loss of CD4+ memory T-lymphocytes in the GALT is observed within the first few weeks of infection [4] . This reservoir is not replenished after peak viremia and although the initial cell loss is not correlated with HIV-1 disease progression , microbial translocation caused by loss of the GALTs function is [4 , 40] . The potential reduction in HIV-1 infection of GALT tissue exposed to SEA/\u03c9-1 may therefore reduce not just cellular infection profiles but also the effects of bacterial translocation . Several cytokines and CC-chemokines have been associated with alterations in HIV-1 infection and disease progression . MIP-1\u03b1 , MIP-1\u03b2 and RANTES are the natural ligands for CCR5 , hence in vitro T-cell cultures containing high levels of these chemokines have lower levels of HIV-1 R5 infection [41 , 42] as has been observed ex vivo [17] . In contrast , we observed a significantly lower percentage of Th cells capable of producing IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 when they were induced by DCs matured under Tmix , Th1 or Th2 promoting conditions in the presence of SEA or r\u03c9-1 ( Figs 3C and 5C ) . The HIV-1 R5 infected fraction however , had a higher percentage of Th cells producing IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 then the total population . This suggests either that these cells were targeted or that IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 were induced upon HIV-1 R5 infection . Addition of monomeric HIV-1 R5 gp120 or recombinant RANTES to HIV-1 X4 infected cell cultures did not induce a similar effect , suggesting the latter is not the case . Targeting of these cells seems equally unlikely since MIP-1\u03b2 competes with HIV-1 R5 for CCR5 binding [12 , 42\u201344] . HIV-1 R5 may induce IFN-\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2 via another mechanism , for example some forms of the viral protein Nef induce MIP-1\u03b2 production in macrophages [45 , 46] while the viral protein Tat can induce MIP-1\u03b2 secretion by neural progenitor cells [47] . Although it may seem counter intuitive that HIV-1 infection stimulates expression of MIP-1\u03b2 , the function of this chemokine is to recruit CD4+ T-lymphocytes to the site of infection , thereby enhancing the number of target cells for HIV-1 replication [48] . It has also been shown that IL-2+ expressing cells are rapidly lost as a consequence of HIV-1 infection due to high levels of infection [17 , 49] . Since IL-2 is added to our cell culture system to ensure T-cell survival , we are unable to analyze the effects of IL-2 on HIV-1 infection with our system . Besides cytokines and chemokines , we explored whether differences in surface expression levels of CCR5 could explain reduced infection with HIV-1 R5 but not X4 . In Th2 cell cultures induced by SEA exposed DCs we found similar percentages of cells expressing CCR5 and similar levels of CCR5 on the surface of each cell ( geometric mean ) compared to Th2 cell cultures induced by unexposed DCs . As observed with SEA , r\u03c9-1 also reduced the DCs capacity to produce cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in response to stimulus [33\u201335] . The mechanism via which a Th2 response is induced is still unknown , with one hypothesis being that the lack of stimuli provided by the DCs to the na\u00efve T cells pushes them into default mode , namely the Th2 phenotype [35 , 50 , 51] . Yet , r\u03c9-1 exposed DCs induced Tmix cell cultures with even lower levels of HIV-1 R5 infection showed a reduced percentage of cells expressing CCR5 as well as a lower level of CCR5 expression per cell . Consequently , although CCR5 is not the main mechanism responsible for reduction in HIV-1 R5 infection it will likely contribute to the overall reduction of infection observed in Tmix cell cultures induced by DCs exposed to r\u03c9-1 . There are several hypotheses to explain the reduced infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes , one of which is the capacity of SEA and r\u03c9-1 exposed DCs to induce regulatory T ( Treg ) cells [52 , 53] . Treg cells are susceptible to HIV-1 although several studies demonstrate that infection is restricted . It has been demonstrated that Treg cells were less susceptible to HIV-1 ( R5 ) infection than effector memory T-lymphocytes while X4 viruses gave higher or similar levels of infection [54] . Further comparisons revealed these cells expressed similar levels of CD4 , CCR5 and CXCR4 on their surface and produced similar levels of CC-chemokine production . Although no explanation was provided , the cellular activation status as well as FoxP3 interference patterns were thought to play a role . Some studies support the notion that FoxP3 inhibits HIV-1 infection by interfering with HIV-1\u2019s LTR transcription activation [55 , 56] while others demonstrate enhanced HIV-1 production in FoxP3 positive cells [57 , 58] . The role of FoxP3 seems to be dependent on the viral strain as well as the culture protocol used for the cells . Another hypothesis is that virus production may be limited but not susceptibility [59] , or that viral restriction factors , such as APOBEC3G may limit infectivity [60] . Further phenotypic characterisation of T-cells induced by SEA exposed DCs and more specifically r\u03c9-1 will undoubtedly identify additional cellular differentiation markers that associate with HIV-1 infection and/or replication with potential implications for induction of viral latency . A more in-depth analysis of SEA and r\u03c9-1 alterations to expression patterns of specific transcription factors associated with Th cell differentiation will further highlight the mechanisms responsible and associate such differences with the altered cytokine/chemokine expression patterns . As well as SEA and r\u03c9-1 driving the induction of Th2 phenotypes [32\u201335] , SEA has been shown to down-modulate DC TLR4 as well as LPS induced signalling [30] . More in-depth analysis with human DCs has demonstrated that SEA exposed DCs have enhanced expression of the negative regulators SOCS1 and SHP1 which result in impaired DC maturation and induction of CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation [61] . Similarly , in a murine model system it has been shown that SEA treated DC possess impaired LPS mediated maturation as identified through reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules [62] . Our results support these findings and indicate that SEA/r\u03c9-1 , through interacting with DCs , can induce CD4+ lymphocytes responses with reduced proliferative/activation phenotypes with potential consequences for HIV-1 infection and/or replication . Reduced infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes with R5 but not X4 HIV-1 may restrict initial viral replication or slow the rate at which HIV-1 switches its co-receptor phenotype . Large scale monitoring of study cohorts would need to be performed to identify whether such effects indeed do exist and which would be limited by factors such as parasite load and corresponding egg count . This complexity is confirmed by the discrepancies found in epidemiological studies of co-infected individuals [21 , 22] . The findings that HIV-1 R5 viruses replicated better in Th2 than Th1 cells resulted in the interpretation that treating S . mansoni infection may benefit co-infected patients [20 , 21] . Whether this can correlate to the in vivo setting needs to be determined and as always with such findings , antigenic concentration and the localisation of the source will be instrumental in determining to what capacity co-infection is beneficial . The effects of helminthic infections have been shown to dampen immune inflammatory responses with considerable consequences for diseases associated with such effects [63] . This would suggest that SEA antigens , including \u03ba5 and \u03c9-1 , possess the physiological capacity to influence HIV-1 infection and disease . These skewing effects must ultimately be considered in the context of parasite antigens having the capacity to activate immune responses which provides a complex balance where different antigens have variant effects within co-infected individuals . We provide evidence here that Th cells induced by SEA/r\u03c9-1 exposed DCs are less susceptible to R5 HIV-1 infection , suggesting that helminthic infections may be beneficial when considering HIV-1 . Deciphering the mechanisms may provide a means towards modulating immune responses beneficial for limiting viral transmission or reducing viral loads . Furthermore , these results should be considered in the context of HIV-1 vaccine trials being conducted in regions of the world where S . mansoni infections are endemic .\nSEA was prepared and isolated as described previously [32] . Kappa-5 ( \u03ba5 ) was isolated by soybean agglutinin ( SBA; Sigma , Zwijndrecht , the Netherlands ) affinity chromatography as described previously [64] . The remaining SEA fraction was labeled as \u03ba5 depleted SEA . Omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 were purified from SEA via cation exchange chromatography as previously described [35 , 49 , 65] . Omega-1 was then separated from IPSE/alpha-1 by affinity chromatography using specific anti-IPSE/alpha-1 monoclonal antibodies coupled to an NHS-HiTrap Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's instructions ( GE Healthcare ) . Purified components were concentrated and dialyzed . Omega-1\u2013depleted SEA or IPSE-depleted SEA were prepared by adding back purified IPSE/alpha-1 or omega-1 , respectively , to the remaining SEA fraction left from the cation exchange chromatography . The purity of the preparations was controlled by SDS-PAGE and silver staining . Protein concentrations were tested using the Bradford or BCA procedure [66] . Plant produced r\u03c9-1 and r\u03ba5 were purified from apoplast fluid using HS POROS 50 strong cation exchange ( CEX ) resin ( Applied Biosystems ) as previously described [34] . Apoplast fluids were transferred over G25 Sephadex columns to exchange for CEX binding buffer ( 20 mM phosphate buffered saline ( pH 6 . 0 ) containing 100 mM NaCl ) . The plant derived r\u03c9-1 and r\u03ba-5 molecule is similar to helminthic derived proteins with similar post-translational modifications , specifically glycosylation profiling , as observed in parasites . SF162 ( R5 ) , BAL ( R5 ) and LAI ( X4 ) are replication competent HIV-1 subtype B viruses . SF162and BAL are molecular cloned isolates obtained from HIV-1 infected patients and which utilise CCR5 as co-receptor . LAI represents a molecular cloned virus isolated from an HIV-1 infected patient and utilises the CXCR4 co-receptor for infection . Viruses were passaged on CD4+ enriched T lymphocytes and tissue culture infectious dose ( TCID50 ) values were determined by limiting dilutions on CD4+ enriched T-lymphocytes according to the Reed and Muench method , as previously described [67] . The DC-SIGN binding ELISA was performed as described [10] . Briefly , the components of interest ( SEA , r\u03c9-1 or r\u03ba5 ) were coated at 5 fold dilutions ( 50\u03bcg/ml\u2013 0 . 01\u03bcg/ml on an ELISA plate after which 333ng/ml DC-SIGN-Fc ( R&D systems ) was added . Subsequently , DC-SIGN-Fc was detected by a secondary goat-anti-human-Fc HRP labelled antibody ( Jackson Immunology ) , diluted 1:1000 and using standard ELISA procedures . In the gp140 competition ELISA , 10\u03bcg/ml anti-HIV-1 gp120 antibody D7324 ( Aalto BioReagents Ltd ) was coated on an ELISA plate after which trimeric HIV-1 gp140 ( JR-FL SOSIP . R6-IZ-D7324 ) was added to the plate as previously described [68 , 69] . Meanwhile , 333ng/ml DC-SIGN-Fc ( R&D systems ) was incubated with SEA at limiting dilutions . Next , the mixture was added to the gp140 coated plate and using a secondary HRP labelled goat-anti-human-Fc antibody ( Jackson Immunology ) diluted at 1:1000 , DC-SIGN-Fc binding to the gp140 plate was determined . A more detailed description can be found [68] . The capsid p24 ELISA was performed as standard [8] . In short , an ELISA plate was coated O/N with 10#x00B5;g/ml sheep anti-p24-specific antibody ( Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd . ) . Culture supernatant was added , followed by 4ng/ml mouse anti-HIV-1-p24 alkaline phosphatase conjugate antibody ( Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd . ) . Development solution Lumi-phos plus ( Lumigen Inc . ) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol . The standard curve consists of a serial dilution of Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant HIV-1-p24 ( Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd . ) . Raji DC-SIGN cells ( a kind gift from Prof TBH Geijtenbeek , University of Amsterdam ) , an immortalized B cell line stably transfected with DC-SIGN [5] was cultured in RPMI 1640 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10% FCS , 100U/ml penicillin and 100U/ml streptomycin . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated using ficoll-hypaque density centrifugation from buffy coats purchased from the Netherlands Blood bank ( Sanquin ) . PBMCs of three CCR5 wild-type homozygous donors were pooled and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS , 100U/ml penicillin , 100U/ml streptomycin , 100U/ml recombinant IL-2 and cells were activated with 2\u00b5g/ml phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( Sigma ) . To enrich for CD4+ T-lymphocytes , the CD8+ T-lymphocyte population was depleted using CD8 dynabeads ( Life Technologies ) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol at day 5 . These cells were used for experiments depict ( Fig 1 ) , as for the remaining experiments cells were isolated from fresh blood . Monocytes were isolated from fresh blood using lymphoprep ( Nycomed ) and subsequent percoll ( GE Healthcare ) density gradient ( 34 , 47 . 5 and 60% of standard isotone percoll ) centrifugation . For 6 days monocytes were cultured in IMDM ( Gibco ) containing 5% FCS , 86\u03bcg/ml gentamycin ( Duchefa ) , 500U/ml GM-CSF ( Schering-Plough ) and 10U/ml IL-4 ( Miltenyi ) differentiating them into immature DCs ( iDCs ) . From the PBMC fraction the CD4+ T-cells were isolated using the CD4 T-cell isolation MACS kit ( Miltenyi Biotec . , 130-091-155 ) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol . Subsequently , the CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO- na\u00efve T-cells were isolated from the CD4+ T-lymphocytes using anti-CD45RO-PE ( DAKO , R084301 ) and anti-PE beads ( Miltenyi-Biotec , 130-048-801 ) , described in detail [70] . CD4+ enriched T-cells ( 2x105 cells/well ) were incubated with 25 , 5 or 1\u03bcg/ml SEA or medium ( control ) for 2h in a 96-well flat-bottomed culture plate ( Greiner Bio-One ) , subsequently medium , SF-162 ( TCID50/ml of 200 ) or LAI ( TCID50/ml of 200 ) was added to the well . At day\u2019s 4 , 7 and 12 supernatants were harvested and cells were fed with fresh media . HIV-1 capsid p24 was determined in the supernatants using a standard ELISA protocol . Raji DC-SIGN cells ( 5x104cells/well ) were pre-incubated with 1\u03bcg/ml SEA for 2h after which SF162 ( R5 ) or LAI ( X4 ) viruses were added at an end concentration of 200 TCID50/ml . After a further 2h incubation the cells were washed 3 times with PBS and co-cultured with enriched CD4+ T-lymphocytes ( 2x105 cells/well ) . Viral outgrowth was measured by monitoring capsid p24 at day 4 , 7 and 12 in harvested culture supernatant . HIV-1 capture/transfer by iDCs was conducted in a similar manner with minor modifications; 20 or 100\u03bcg/ml SEA was utilized and the incubation steps were shortened to 30min . A co-culture system was developed where monocytes were pre-incubated with immune skewing reagents in the presence or absence of parasite product ( SEA or r\u03c9-1 ) , before washing and adding to isolated memory T-cells and subsequently monitoring HIV-1 infection profiles or markers of CD4 cell phenotype . Routinely , iDCs from donor A were matured for 2 days with 100ng/ml LPS ( Sigma-Aldrich ) ( which typically generates DCs that induce a Thmix-cell phenotypes ) , 100ng/ml LPS and 100U/ml IFN-\u03b3 ( UCytech ) ( which typically generates DCs that induce a Th1-cell phenotype ) or 100ng/ml LPS and 10\u03bcM PgE2 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) ( which typically generates DCs that induce a Th2-cell phenotype ) either in the absence or presence of 25\u03bcg/ml SEA or 1\u20134\u03bcg/ml r\u03c9-1 . After thoroughly washing the matured DCs 3 times , 5x103 of cells were co-cultured with 2x104 CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO- T-cells ( naive ) from donor B in 96-well flat bottom culture plates and 10pg/ml Staphylococcus enterotoxin B ( SEB ) ( Sigma-Aldrich ) in IMDM , 10% FCS , 86\u03bcg/ml gentamycin ( Duchefa ) . The addition of SEB in combination with allogeneic stimulation of cells provides for maximal T-cell stimulation and proliferation in order to best achieve the numbers required for analysis . Cells were split at day 5 and day 7 with 20U/ml IL-2 being added to the medium . At day 8 , 5x104 cells/well were plated on 96-well flat bottomed plates and infected with SF162 ( TCID50/ml 1000 ) or LAI ( TCID50/ml 200 ) . Since iDCs don\u2019t survive this length of time in culture under these conditions the measured levels of infection represent direct cis-infection of Th-cells , indeed monitoring cell phenotypes indicated that only CD4+ lymphocytes were present at time of infection . Day 5 and 7 post-infection cells were re-stimulated for 6h with 10ng/ml PMA ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , 1\u03bcg/ml ionomycin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , 10\u03bcg/ml brefeldin A ( Sigma-Aldrich ) supplemented with 0 . 1\u03bcg/ml T1294 ( Pepscan Therapeutics BV ) to prevent new infections during this period . Subsequently , cells were fixed in 3 . 7% formaldehyde and stored for no more than 1 week at 4\u2070C in FACS buffer ( PBS+ 2%FCS ) for flow cytometry analysis measuring intracellular viral p24 antigen as well as an array of cell surface markers or intracellular cytokines/chemokines . Where monomeric gp120 ( SF162 ) ( Immune Technology Corp . ) or RANTES ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added the experiments were performed similarly . These compounds ( concentrations in text ) were added to the T-cell culture 24h after LAI infection and four days later the cells were re-stimulated . Experiments with SEA show the results of at least five different donor combinations and for experiments using r\u03c9-1 four different donor combinations are depicted in figures ( see respective Fig legends ) . To measure intracellular activation markers , cells were permeabilized for 30min with PermWash at RT ( BD Pharmingen ) and subsequently stained with p24-PE ( Beckman Coulter ) and IFN-\u03b3-FitC , IL2-PerCp-Cy5 . 5 , IL-4-APC , TNF-\u03b1-PE-CF594 , Mip-1\u03b2-AlexaFluor700 ( all from BD Bioscience ) for 30min at 4\u00b0C at a pre-determined dilution . Next , these cells were washed once with PermWash and taken up in FACS buffer ( PBS+ 2%FCS ) after which they were analyzed using a FACS Canto II machine . For determining CCR5 surface expression , T-cells obtained from our T-cell outgrowth model were fixed in 3 . 7% formaldehyde before HIV-1 infection and stored for no more than 1 week at 4\u00b0C in FACS buffer . These cells were stained in FACS buffer with CCR5 PE-Cy7 ( Biolegend ) for 30min at RT , washed with FACS buffer and measured . Shown in histograms are cytokine producing T-cells with samples taken 5 and 7 days after HIV-1 infection with the optimal time point being determined by the percentage of live cells ( >50% ) and level of HIV-1 infection , which varied per donor and per virus . Gating strategies and flow cytometric controls are represented ( S3A Fig and S3B Fig , respectively ) . All cells were isolated from anonymized buffy coats purchased through the Nederlands Blood Bank ( Sanquin ) where IRB approval was granted and donors signed a specifically consented in the additional use of samples for research purposes as outlined in the research contract between the AMC and Sanquin ( number NVT0202 . 02 ) . Data was analyzed using an unpaired t-test when comparing two groups and a 1-way ANOVA when comparing several groups ( Fig 1 ) . For the remaining figures the data is corrected for the systematic differences between donors using factor correction [71] . Subsequently , within each specific T-cell population the effect of induction with SEA/r\u03c9-1 exposed or unexposed DCs was compared using a paired T-test whereas data between two T-cell population\u2019s data was compared using an unpaired T-test . Additionally for Fig 2 , a 2-way ANOVA was performed to determine whether there was an interaction between the T-cell population infected and the usage of SEA .", "prediction": "Parasitic helminths eva a parasitic helminth.

Such effects will likely have consequences for HIV-1 transmission and disease progression .

We determined that SEA , through kappa-5 , can potently block DC-SIGN mediated HIV-1 trans-infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes , but not block cis-infection . Dendritic cells ( DC ) exposed to SEA during maturation under Th2 skewing conditions , induce T-cell populations that are less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection compared to cells induced by unexposed DCs . HIV-1 X4 infection was unaffected . This restricted infection profile was not associated with down-modulation of CCR5 surface expression or observed differences in cytokine/chemokine production . Using recombinant omega-1 , an abundant component of SEA , HIV-1 R5 infection was similarly inhibited with no effect on HIV-1 X4 infection levels . Hence SEA possesses antigens , namely omega-1 , that can modulate HIV-1 infection and potentially influence disease course in co-infected individuals ."}

HCMV infects a wide variety of cell types using distinct entry pathways that involve different forms of the gH/gL glycoprotein: gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 as well as the viral fusion glycoprotein , gB . However , the minimal or core fusion machinery ( sufficient for cell-cell fusion ) is just gH/gL and gB . Here , we demonstrate that HCMV gB and gH/gL form a stable complex early after their synthesis and in the absence of other viral proteins . gH/gL can interact with gB mutants that are unable to mediate cell-cell fusion . gB-gH/gL complexes included as much as 16\u201350% of the total gH/gL in HCMV virus particles . In contrast , only small amounts of gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 complexes were found associated with gB . All herpesviruses express gB and gH/gL molecules and most models describing herpesvirus entry suggest that gH/gL interacts with gB to mediate membrane fusion , although there is no direct evidence for this . For herpes simplex virus ( HSV-1 ) it has been suggested that after receptor binding gH/gL binds to gB either just before , or coincident with membrane fusion . Therefore , our results have major implications for these models , demonstrating that HCMV gB and gH/gL forms stable gB-gH/gL complexes that are incorporated virions without receptor binding or membrane fusion . Moreover , our data is the best support to date for the proposal that gH/gL interacts with gB .\nEntry of all herpesviruses into cells requires at least two membrane glycoproteins: gB and gH/gL that form the primordial and core fusion machinery . The structures of HSV-1 and Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) gB molecules are similar to the vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) G-protein , which is a type III fusion protein and strongly suggest that herpesvirus gB proteins are all fusion proteins [1 , 2] . However , unlike VSV G-protein , herpesvirus gB molecules require additional proteins for membrane fusion and entry . The most extensive data involves the \u03b1-herpesvirus HSV-1 that expresses glycoprotein gD that binds receptors , then it is believed that gD interacts with glycoprotein gH/gL that then interacts with gB to trigger membrane fusion [3] . For the \u03b3-herpesvirus EBV , gH/gL or gH/gL/gp42 binds receptors and may transmit signals to gB for fusion [4] . Similarly , we have proposed that the \u03b2-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) utilizes different forms of gH/gL , a trimer of gH/gL/gO and a pentamer of gH/gL/UL128-131 to bind distinct receptors and this promotes gB-mediated entry fusion [5] . Thus , a major tenet of all the models describing entry of \u03b1- , \u03b2- , and \u03b3-herpesviruses suggests that gH/gL is activated by receptor binding ( or by gD for HSV-1 ) and then binds to gB and in so doing , triggers gB for fusion . At present , evidence for direct interactions between herpesvirus gB and gH/gL molecules has relied on indirect measurements involving transfected cells or in vitro studies . Bimolecular complementation ( BiMC ) studies involving HSV-1 gB and gH/gL fused to fragments of fluorescent proteins ( YFP or GFP ) and transfected into cells demonstrated that gB and gH/gL interact , but only after gD first interacts with receptors and then interacts with gH/gL [6 , 7] . HSV-1 gB and gH/gL interactions coincided with cell-cell fusion and HSV-1 gB \u201cfusion loop\u201d mutants that fail in fusion did not interact with gH/gL , suggesting that insertion of fusion loops into membranes coincides with or precedes the interaction [8] . However , the interpretation of the BiMC results was complicated by other observations that these HSV-1 glycoprotein-YFP fusion proteins interacted illegitimately with paramyxovirus glycoprotein-YFP constructs involving affinities between complementary YFP fragments [9] . Other important evidence for HSV-1 gB-gH/gL interactions involved in vitro experiments in which soluble gB associated with liposomes through \u201cfusion loops\u201d and promoted association of soluble gH/gL with these liposomes [10] . There was also evidence that HCMV gB and gH/gL can interact based on FRET analyses [11] . Many studies support the hypothesis that herpesvirus gH/gL proteins triggers gB glycoproteins for fusion , but there has been no direct evidence for this with wild type glycoproteins in virus-infected cells or in virus particles . HCMV entry into fibroblasts involves fusion with the plasma membrane and requires gB and gH/gL/gO [12 , 13] . Entry into epithelial and endothelial cells involves macropinocytosis or endocytosis that requires gB , gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 [13\u201315] . We provided evidence involving interference studies that suggest gH/gL/gO binds critical receptors on fibroblasts and gH/gL/UL128-131 binds receptors on epithelial and endothelial cells [16 , 17] . Importantly , virus entry differs from HCMV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion , which requires only gB and gH/gL ( without gO or UL128-131 ) and defines gB and gH/gL as the minimal fusion machinery [18] . In our previous studies of cell-cell fusion we observed that a HCMV gH/gL-specific antibody coprecipitated gB but these results were highly preliminary , no available gB antibodies precipitated gH/gL [18] . Here , we demonstrate that panels of gB- , gH- and gL-specific antibodies , as well as tagged gB , precipitated gB-gH/gL complexes from cells without the requirement of other HCMV proteins . Surprisingly , gB bound to gH/gL early after glycoprotein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . The interaction was observed in HCMV infected cells and in extracellular virus particles with 16\u201350% of the total gH/gL bound to gB . gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 bound poorly to gB in virions . Therefore , a significant fraction of HCMV gH/gL ( devoid of gO or UL128-131 ) forms stable complexes with gB in virions and these interactions do not require receptors . Moreover , mutant forms of HCMV gB that lacked the capacity to mediate membrane fusion ( e . g . fusion loop mutants ) interacted with gH/gL so that fusion activity of gB is not necessary . These data provide a different model for how HCMV gB and gH/gL molecules interact and function compared with models for HSV-1 entry . Our data support the hypothesis that stable , preformed HCMV gB-gH/gL complexes are present in the virion envelope and that gB-gH/gL complexes might initiate membrane fusion between the virion envelope and cellular membranes .\nWe expressed HCMV glycoprotein gB from either the clinical strain TR or the lab strain AD169 along with TR gH/gL using non-replicating ( E1- ) adenovirus ( Ad ) vectors in ARPE-19 epithelial cells . The cells were labeled with 35S-methionine/cysteine , lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 ( NP-40 ) , and the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) using gH-specific monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions . IP with the gH-specific MAbs 14-4b or AP-86 produced bands representing 85-kDa gH , 30-kDa gL , as well as a weaker 116-kDa band representing gB ( Fig 1A ) . The amount of gB co-IP\u2019d with MAb 14-4b was higher than MAb AP86 and perhaps is related to the fact that MAb 14-4b recognizes a conformational-dependent epitope , while MAb AP86 recognizes a linear epitope . Similar IPs were performed with a rabbit anti-gL peptide sera that precipitated the 85-kDa gH polypeptide , the 30-kDa gL polypeptide , as well as the 116-kDa gB polypeptide ( Fig 1B ) . Addition of the gL peptide in the IP reaction reduced IP of gL and gH and also abolished the co-precipitation of gB ( Fig 1B ) . Reciprocal IPs were also performed with radiolabeled extracts using the anti-human gB MAb 758 . This gB MAb precipitated a band representing the 116-kDa gB along with a weaker band representing 85-kDa gH ( Fig 1C ) . We also performed IP experiments from radiolabeled ARPE-19 cells with buffers containing different detergents to rule out non-selective IP of proteins due to micelle formation or other aggregates . IPs performed using 1% digitonin or 1% octyl glucoside resulted in co-IP of gB with gH/gL similar to IPs performed with buffer containing 1% NP-40 ( Fig 2A\u20132C ) . These experiments were repeated after 4-fold dilution of the cell extracts . The results of these experiments showed no major reduction in the amount of gB that was co-IP\u2019d with gH/gL from the diluted samples ( 4X ) when compared to the undiluted IP\u2019s ( 1X ) , confirming that the association of gB with gH/gL is specific and sufficiently stable to withstand dilution ( Fig 2A\u20132C ) . We noted that the amount of gB that was co-IP\u2019d with gH/gL varied . In some cases , anti-gH MAbs co-IP\u2019d as much gB as anti-gB MAbs ( Fig 1A and 1C ) , whereas in other cases it was much less ( Fig 2A\u20132C ) . We also noted that gB expression was higher from the AD169-gB Ad vector compared to the TR-gB Ad vector ( Fig 1A and 1C ) and attribute this to earlier versus later generation Ad construction ( e . g . different transfer and Ad plasmids that could contain variations in cis-acting sequences within promoters ) . Thus , for all subsequent Ad transductions , we used the AD169-gB Ad vector . ARPE-19 epithelial cells or MRC-5 fibroblasts were transduced with different combinations of Ad vectors expressing gB and gH/gL and proteins IP\u2019d from 1% NP-40 cell extracts with anti-gH MAb 14-4b . Proteins were transferred to membranes after SDS PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted with anti-gB rabbit serum or anti-gH MAb AP86 . Under these conditions , we were able to detect gB in the gH/gL IP from extracts of APRE-19 and MRC-5 fibroblasts co-expressing gB and gH/gL ( Fig 3A ) . Similar IPs performed with the gH-specific MAb with cells expressing only gB or only gH/gL did not co-precipitate gB ( Fig 3A ) . Quantification of the amount of gB that was co-IP\u2019d with gH/gL indicated that 16 . 5% and 13% of the total gB was precipitated with gH/gL from ARPE-19 or MRC-5 cells , respectively ( Fig 3A ) . Although we were able to IP gH/gL with gB using the human gB-specific MAb 738 from radiolabeled ARPE-19 cells ( Fig 1C ) , several other gB antibodies including anti-gB MAb 27\u2013156 , did not co-IP gH/gL . One possibility is that certain gB antibodies such as 27\u2013156 recognize a gB epitiope that is obscured by gH/gL binding . Thus , we produced a panel of new gB-specific MAbs by immunizing mice with a soluble form of gB [19] and screening for antibodies that were not blocked for binding to gB that was fixed on plates and pre-incubated with MAb 27\u2013156 . IP-western experiments showed that at least three of our new gB MAbs were able to co-IP gH/gL from Ad-transduced APRE-19 cells ( Fig 3B ) . To further characterize the interaction , ARPE-19 cells were transduced with an Ad vector expressing gB with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag ( FLAG-gB ) . Western blot analysis of IP\u2019s from cell lysates showed that an anti-FLAG MAb was able to co-IP gH/gL only from cells co-expressing FLAG-gB with gH/gL ( Fig 3C ) . No gH/gL or untagged gB was detected from anti-FLAG IP\u2019s even though the untagged Ad gB was transduced at the same MOI as Ad gB-FLAG . We noted that the ability to co-IP gH/gL with gB MAbs or anti-FLAG MAbs was still less efficient ( 1\u20136% ) than co-IPs performed with gH MAbs . To further characterize the specificity of our IP-western experiments , we performed IPs with extracts from cells co-expressing HCMV and HSV-1 glycoproteins . When HSV-1 gH/gL was co-expressed with HCMV gB and HCMV gB IP\u2019d with the anti-HCMV gB MAb 15H7 , no HSV-1 gH was co-IP\u2019d ( Fig 4A ) . Similarly , co-expression of HSV-1 gD with HCMV gH/gL followed by IP of HCMV gH/gL using MAb 14-4b did not show evidence for co-precipitation of HSV-1 gD by western blot analyses ( Fig 4B ) . We also attempted to provide evidence for complexes of HSV-1 glycoproteins in Ad-transduced cells . ARPE-19 cells were transduced with Ad vectors expressing HSV-1 gD , gH , gL , and gB along with an Ad vector expressing the cellular receptor nectin-1 . At 24 hrs after transduction , most of the cells in the monolayer were undergoing fusion , similar to what we observe with HCMV glycoproteins . At this point , 1% NP-40 extracts of cells were made and HSV-1 gH/gL and gB proteins IP\u2019d and analyzed by western blot . IP of HSV-1 gH/gL with MAb 53S showed no evidence of gB and IP of HSV-1 gB with MAb SS10 showed no evidence of HSV-1 gH/gL ( Fig 4C ) . We also tested whether IP of HSV-1 gB and gH/gL co-IP\u2019d HSV-1 gD . Western blot analyses of these IPs provided no evidence that HSV-1 gD could co-IP with HSV-1 gB or gH/gL ( Fig 4D ) . Moreover , reciprocal IP\u2019s performed with the anti-gD MAb DL6 also failed to provide evidence that HSV-1 gB or gH/gL could be co-IP\u2019d with HSV-1 gD ( Fig 4E ) . Pulse-chase experiments were performed to characterize the kinetics of gB-gH/gL complex formation using Ad-transduced cells . ARPE-19 cells were transduced with Ad vectors expressing gB and gH/gL for 20\u201324 hr then the cells were radiolabeled with 35S-methionine/cysteine for 15 min and the label chased for 60 , 120 or 240 min . and the proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions . In the 15 min pulse sample , gB was co-IP\u2019d with gH/gL and this quantity of gB remained stable for 60 min before slowly declining with about half remaining even after 240 min ( Fig 5 ) . Therefore , gB-gH/gL complexes form after synthesis in the ER and are relatively stable . Note that the quantity of gB complexed with gH/gL was ~38% of the gH/gL precipitated in the pulse sample from the transduced cells . The results to this point involved expression of just gB and gH/gL using non-replicating Ad vectors . To assess complexes in HCMV-infected cells , human fibroblasts were infected with HCMV BADrUL131 [20] and at 3 days post-infection cell extracts were prepared with 1% NP-40 . gH/gL was IP\u2019d using MAb 14-4b or an irrelevant MAb specific for FLAG ( used as a negative control ) then subjected to western blotting with gB or gH antibodies . The results of these IPs showed that gH antibodies could co-IP gB with gH/gL from HCMV infected cells ( Fig 6A ) . To detect gB-gH/gL complexes in virions , extracellular HCMV virions were purified from cell culture supernatants of fibroblasts infected with HCMV BADrUL131 at 10 days post-infection . The virus particles were solubilized in 1% NP-40 and proteins IP\u2019d with gH-specific MAb 14-4b , an irrelevant anti-FLAG antibody , or a MAb specific for the HCMV glycoprotein M ( gM ) that is present in the virion . Western blots analysis of the IPs under reducing conditions showed that gB was co-IP\u2019d along with gH/gL , amounting to 2 . 6% of the total gB in the detergent extracts ( Fig 6B ) . It is not yet clear that MAb 14-4b precipitates all of the gB present in the gB-gH/gL complex because a much higher fraction of gH/gL is present in these complexes ( see next section ) . It is also important to note that anti-gH MAb 14-4b also recognizes trimer ( gH/gL/gO ) and pentamer ( gH/gL/UL128-131 ) complexes , which might compete with binding to gB-gH/gL complexes ( see below ) . Lysates from extracellular HCMV particles were also subjected to IP using rabbit anti-gL peptide serum . Similar to IP\u2019s with antibodies to gH , the rabbit anti-gL serum also co-precipitated gB and this amounted to about 2 . 5% ( Fig 6C ) . However we also blotted the gL IP for gH and noted that only about 8% of the total gH was IP\u2019d with gL antibodies , suggesting that our anti-gL peptide serum does not efficiently IP gH/gL complexes from virion lysates ( Fig 6C ) . Confirmation that our virus preparations were not contaminated with cellular proteins was confirmed by blotting for the cellular protein calnexin , which did not show calnexin in virion preparations ( Fig 6D ) . We concluded that gB-gH/gL complexes are found in HCMV infected cells and in extracellular virus particles .\nWe found HCMV gB-gH/gL complexes in extracellular virions suggesting that these complexes form before gB is activated for fusion and entry . What was of interest here was whether HCMV gB must be fusion competent in order to interact with gH/gL . With HSV-1 , gB \u201cfusion loop\u201d mutants did not interact with gH/gL in BiMC assays and BiMC fluorescence was only observed around sites of cell-cell fusion [6] . We previously described the HCMV gB mutants gBA154W and gBW240A [24] , that contain single substitutions in gB domains which are predicted to be homologous to EBV and HSV-1 fusion loops [25] . Using cell-cell fusion assays , gBA154W and gBW240A did not promote cell-cell fusion and were unable to promote entry in trans [24] . To determine whether these gB mutants could interact with gH/gL , ARPE-19 epithelial cells were transduced with Ad vectors to express wild type gB , gBA154W , or gBW240A along with wild-type gH/gL and then proteins were IP\u2019d from the cell extracts using MAb 14-4b . Western blots probed with an anti-gB-specific rabbit serum showed that the gB mutants gBA154W and gBW240A formed complexes with gH/gL ( Fig 8A ) . A third HCMV gB construct , gB\u0394CT , that lacks the entire cytoplasmic domain of gB and displays no cell-cell fusion activity [18 , 24] also interacted with gH/gL ( Fig 8A ) . These observations fit well with the results above that indicate gB-gH/gL complexes form early after synthesis and are incorporated into the virion and clearly indicate that gB-gH/gL complexes form even when gB is not capable of fusion . To attempt to identify gH/gL residues that make contact with gB , we made several mutations in gH and gL involving clusters of linear 2\u20135 amino acid sequences of HCMV gH and gL that were predicted to be on protein surfaces based on the homology with the EBV and HSV-1 gH/gL structures . Our rough predictions of the structures of HCMV TR gH/gL involved comparisons to HSV-1 and EBV gH/gL sequences using the RaptorX Structure alignment server ( http://raptorx . uchicago . edu/DeepAlign ) . This produced a crude 3D structure of HCMV gH/gL that was used along with primary sequence alignments between HCMV , HSV-1 , and EBV gH/gL molecules [25] to design mutations in HCMV gH/gL that were likely to affect protein surfaces and yet avoid disrupting gH/gL dimer formation or produce gross misfolding . We made fewer mutations near the N-terminal of gH given that this region is where EBV and HSV-1 gH binds gL [25 , 26] . A total of 42 mutations in the gH polypeptide and 20 mutations in gL polypeptide were made , in each case , replacing the existing residues with alanine ( S1 and S2 Tables ) . All the gH mutants including the wild-type gH control were fused to a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag to ensure that we could IP gH ( without using the conformation-specific gH MAb 14-4b ) . Mutant gH and wild type gH ( with FLAG ) proteins were co-expressed with wild-type or mutant gL in conjunction with gB by plasmid transfection into 293T cells . The cells were radiolabeled at 48 hr post-transfection and proteins IP\u2019d from detergent extracts using a FLAG-specific MAb . For all the mutants , heterodimeric gH/gL complexes were detected ( S1 and S2 Tables ) . In fact , none of the mutants we predicted using the methods above produced unstable gH or gL molecules . Moreover , all of the gH and gL mutants assembled complexes with gB ( S1 and S2 Tables ) . We note that one of these mutants involved the gL cysteine-144 that has been shown to abolish interactions with gO and UL128 [27] , suggesting that unlike trimer and pentamer complexes , this residue is not involved in gB-gH/gL complex formation ( S2 Table ) . One might characterize these results as negative data , but we would suggest that these mutants will shape further studies of gB-gH/gL interactions . The results also suggest that the surfaces of gH/gL that interact with gB include discontinuous sequences ( more than a single continuous polypeptide chain ) , so that gB-gH/gL interactions are not abolished by simple mutations involving small substitutions . These results also fit with the stability of the gB-gH/gL complexes . These data also indicate that the interaction of gB with gH/gL does not entail the same disulfide bonds formed between gO , UL128-131 , and gH/gL complexes .\nAll herpesviruses express gH/gL and gB homologues and for most , it is clear that both glycoproteins are absolutely required for entry . It has been frequently suggested that herpesvirus gH/gL molecules interact with gB to trigger gB fusion activity and virus entry . Support for these models largely involves studies with HSV-1 involving bimolecular complementation in transfected cells and in vitro assays of soluble glycoproteins binding to liposomes [7 , 8 , 10] . These methods sought to explain the need for both HSV-1 gH/gL and gB in entry , but none of the data produced strong support for direct interactions of gH/gL with gB in virus-infected cells or virions . There has been no evidence of any interactions between gB and gH/gL in \u03b3- or \u03b2-herpesviruses . Here , we describe a stable complex formed between HCMV gB and gH/gL that we observed under a variety of expression conditions , using different detergents , following dilution of extracts , and using a panel of gH- , gL- , gB- , and epitope tag-specific antibodies . As further evidence of specificity , HSV-1 gH/gL and gD not interact with HCMV gB or gH/gL and HCMV gH/gL did not co-IP with gM from virions . HCMV gB-gH/gL complexes were produced early after protein synthesis in the ER in Ad-transduced cells and assembled without other HCMV proteins . Moreover , gB fusion loop mutants and truncated forms of gB that lack fusion activity interacted well with gH/gL . These observations fit together well if one considers the gB-gH/gL complex forming early , being incorporated into virions and then ultimately acting in membrane fusion ( during virus entry ) after virus is release from cells and binds onto cell surfaces . Importantly , gB-gH/gL complexes were detected in HCMV infected cells and in extracellular virions , amounting to 16\u201350% of the total gH/gL in the virion ( Fig 7C , 7D and 7H ) . The quantities of gB that was IP\u2019d with gH/gL from detergent extracts of virions were lower , 2 . 5\u20132 . 6% in the experiments shown ( Fig 6B and 6C ) . However , it is important to note that various conditions involving IP\u2019s of gH/gL from Ad-transduced cells produced a larger fraction of the gB present in gB-gH/gL complexes . In cells radiolabeled following Ad-transduction , the signal for gB was ~38% of gH/gL signal ( Fig 5 ) . In experiments in which gH/gL was IP\u2019d from Ad transduced cells and blotted with gB Abs , 13\u201316% of gB co-IP\u2019d with gH/gL ( Fig 3A ) and 6% of gH/gL co-IP\u2019d with gB ( Fig 3C ) . There are at least three explanations for these differences between the quantities of gB complexed with gH/gL in virions versus those involving Ad-transduced cells . First , in virions there are three forms of gH/gL complexes , gH/gL , gH/gL/gO , and gH/gL/UL128-131 , and the gH/gL antibodies used here for IPs recognize all three species . gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 were not expressed in Ad-transduced cells . Thus , there may be competition for binding of different gH/gL forms that reduce the quantities of gB-gH/gL complexes detected from virions . Second , we have a limited number of gH/gL MAbs and it could well be that those we used inefficiently recognize the form of gH/gL that is complexed with gB . In Ad-transduced cells ( where more gB is IP\u2019d ) the cells are undergoing gB-gH/gL-mediated cell-cell fusion . Thus , at any given time in Ad-transduced cells , there may be pre-fusion , fusion , and post-fusion forms of these glycoproteins and the ratios of these different forms is likely very dynamic over time and might vary substantially in different experiments . gH/gL is just as likely to be undergoing conformational changes as is the fusion protein gB . By contrast , most of the gH/gL and gB glycoproteins found in virions must be in the pre-fusion form if viruses are to be able to enter cells . These conformational changes are likely to have a significant effect on the capacity of antibodies to IP gB , gH/gL and the gB-gH/gL complexes . Thus , our gH/gL antibodies may prefer the conformational changes in gH/gL that are associated with membrane fusion so that we obtain more gB-gH/gL complexes from Ad-transduced cells compared with virions . Third , it is important to note that IPs are rarely efficient . For example , it is often the case that an equal amount of antigen can be IP\u2019d from the supernatants after the initial IP is performed ( e . g . IP then re-IP ) suggesting that only a fraction of the total antigen can be immuno-captured . Related to this point , it is clear that different antibodies pull down quite different amounts of the gB-gH/gL complexes . ( See for example , Fig 1A and 1B involving different gH and gL antibodies . ) . Different methods of expression and labeling conditions also likely produced different quantities of complexes . Nevertheless , our observations that 16\u201350% of the total gH/gL was complexed with gB in virions and as much as 38% of gB was complexed with gH/gL in Ad-transduced cells demonstrate that these complexes can form in a relatively efficient manner . Given that extracellular virions are only one snapshot of the virus life cycle and these pictures were taken with only a few antibodies , the maximum percentage of gB in these complexes might have been under estimated . These observations are fundamentally important because this is the first solid evidence for direct gB-gH/gL interactions and , importantly , in virus-infected cells and virions . The previous support for HSV-1 gB-gH/gL interactions involving bimolecular complementation ( BiMC ) showed fluorescence and fusion . Related to points made in the last paragraph , there were no measurements of what fraction of gB interacted with gH/gL in these BiMC experiments . HCMV gB and gH/gL are sufficient for cell-cell fusion and are , thus , the minimal fusion machinery [13 , 18] . The presence of a gB-gH/gL complex in the HCMV virion suggests that this trimeric or multimeric structure might be involved in entry fusion , though we acknowledge that we have not yet established the functional significance of the gB-gH/gL complexes here . Nevertheless , our observations are highly significance because of the dogma , the prevailing premise that both gB and gH/gL are essential for entry and must therefore interact . As we said , the BiMC studies supported these interactions but did not shown them directly . Our observations that as much as 16\u201350% of virion gH/gL is complexed with gB , is strong support for the hypothesis that gB-gH/gL complexes act during virus entry . Direct proof that gB-gH/gL complexes are essential for or play important roles in virus entry fusion or cell-cell fusion ( i . e . , functional significance ) requires mutations that abolish complex formation . We constructed 62 mutants involving substitutions of 3\u20135 amino acids in gH and gL which were designed to alter putative surface residues but none abolished interaction of gH/gL with gB . The C-terminal and fusion loop mutants of gB also bound gH/gL . In order to definitively establish the functional significance of gB-gH/gL complexes , more mutants that abolish complexes must be made . This will likely require larger mutations in gH/gL or gB , e . g . affecting more than a single continuous sequence of gH or gL to prevent gB binding . The observation that gB-gH/gL complexes are relatively stable in detergents and in pulse-chase experiments suggests that extensive surfaces of these proteins might contact one another or that there are covalent interactions . Mutations to abolish these contacts require construction of larger mutations and are best done with the structures of the protein in hand . HCMV has lagged behind HSV and EBV in terms of glycoprotein structures , mapped MAb epitopes , and other reagents , so that the structure-function studies required to demonstrate functional significance extend far beyond the scope of this report . A major advance derived from our observations differs from the current view of how HSV-1 gB and gH/gL proteins interact . The BiMC results suggested that HSV-1 gB and gH/gL are positioned as separate molecules in the virion envelope , but bind to one another only just before or during membrane fusion [8] . Blocking the fusion activity of gB ( fusion loop mutations ) abolished HSV-1 gB-gH/gL interactions . It appeared that HSV-1 gH/gL is altered by gD binding to receptors then transiently interacts with gB , but the nature of this and whether it indeed occurs is not clear . Consistent with this , we did not detect HSV-1 gB-gH/gL complexes in detergent extracts of Ad-transduced cells . By contrast , HCMV glycoproteins form stable HCMV gB-gH/gL complexes irrespective of gB fusion activity . This is considered fundamentally different from HSV-1 . This difference may relate to the fact that HSV-1 expresses a separate receptor binding protein , gD , whereas gH/gL homologues in HCMV and EBV apparently bind receptors [4 , 5 , 28] . That said the differences between HSV-1 and HCMV fusion machineries might not be so great . Our studies could be viewed as suggesting a fusion model with a different starting point , i . e . , HCMV gH/gL in pre-established complexes with gB in the virion triggers gB for fusion , whereas HSV-1 glycoproteins need to come together . We were surprised that the gH/gL/gO trimer and gH/gL/UL128-131 pentamer complexes did not efficiently interact with gB in virions because these two forms of gH/gL have important functions in the virion envelope . Viruses that lack gO fail to enter all cells tested and UL128-131 are necessary for entry into many cell types ( reviewed [5] ) . In one experiment , a gB MAb precipitated 50% of the gH from virions , but only 1\u20132% of the gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 complexes . In two other experiments , 16% and 21% of the gH was precipitated with a gB MAb and no detectable gH/gL/gO or gH/gL/UL128-131 was observed . Note that these results can not be compared to our observations that only 2 . 5% of the total gB in virions was in the complex , as the analyses for gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/ul128-131 was internally controlled , one gB MAb was used to IP , then blots were performed with gO , UL130 , or gH MAbs , comparing the IP\u2019d proteins to the total in the extract . Together , our IP assays argue for a gH/gL species , that is devoid of gO and UL128-131 that is in complex with gB . This is consistent with a previous report showing gH/gL heterodimers in the virion that are not disulfide liked to gO or UL128 [29] . In addition , a dimer of gH/gL heterodimers has been described in transfected cells but this gH/gL species has not yet been shown in virions [27] . Whether it is the gH/gL heterodimer or a dimer of gH/gL heterodimers that is bound to gB is not clear at this point and we have not ruled out other viral proteins present in the complex . Whether the gH/gL/gO trimer and gH/gL/UL128-131 pentamer interact with or \u201ctalk to\u201d gB-gH/gL complexes during virus entry is not yet clear . Our previous interference studies suggested that gH/gL/gO binds receptors in fibroblasts , whereas gH/gL/UL128-131 binds epithelial and endothelial cell receptors [16 , 17] . gH/gL interfered poorly or not at all in these experiments . Recently , soluble gH/gL/UL128-131 , but not soluble gH/gL , blocked HCMV entry into epithelial cells [30] . Thus , it seems possible or even likely that the trimer and pentamer complexes bind receptors and act upstream of entry fusion . It is not yet clear how this fits with observations that gH/gL and gB are sufficient for cell-cell fusion [13 , 18] . In cell-cell fusion , cells might be in close proximity without the requirements for certain types of receptor binding , and gH/gL and gB represent the core fusion machinery . Given that HCMV enters some cells at the plasma membrane and others after endocytosis , it is reasonable to believe that activation of the HCMV fusion machinery must be tightly regulated during entry but perhaps not during cell-cell fusion . Observations that HCMV gH/gL interacts with gB in the ER may have implications for how gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 assemble . There was previous evidence for competition between gO and UL128-131 for binding to gH/gL [23] . This competition was recently explained by observations that a cysteine ( C144 ) present in gL forms disulfide bonds with either gO or UL128 [27] . Our data raises the possibility that gB might also compete with UL128-131 and gO for binding to gH/gL . However , our mutagenesis of C144 in gL did not abolish binding of gH/gL with gB . Efforts to determine whether gB is covalently bound to gH/gL have been inconclusive to date because of the complex nature of high molecular weight forms of gB and gH/gL in virions: dimers , trimers , pentamers and blots of non-reduced samples were complex . One intriguing model derived from our results suggests the notion that the gB found in complex with gH/gL might be in the pre-fusion form . This is supported by observations that virions contain gB-gH/gL complexes and since these glycoproteins are designed for virus entry , virions represent the biologically relevant population of these glycoproteins . Given that some or all of the gB in virions must be in the pre-fusion form in order for virus entry to occur , it is possible that gH/gL that is complexed with pre-fusion gB can respond to receptors or other stimuli then this gH/gL can trigger adjacent gB for fusion . However , we acknowledge that we have no direct evidence as to whether the gB associated with gH/gL in Ad-transduced cells or the virion is in the pre-fusion form . The structures of HSV-1 and EBV gB were derived from soluble proteins secreted from insect cells without gH/gL and were both apparently in the post-fusion forms [1 , 2] . In the virion or as soluble proteins , gH/gL might stabilize gB in the pre-fusion form . Thus , it might be possible to derive the structures of gB-gH/gL complexes in order to obtain the structure of the pre-fusion form of gB . This would have important implications for the development of HCMV vaccines and antibodies that block the transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion gB would likely be important . Previous efforts to develop subunit vaccines involved soluble forms of gB and were not successful [31] .\nHuman MRC-5 embryonic lung fibroblasts and human retinal pigmented epithelial cells ( ARPE-19 ) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) or DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 ( 1:1 ) medium supplemented with 10% FBS , respectively . Neonatal human dermal fibroblasts ( nHDFs ) were obtained from Invitrogen and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS . The HCMV bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) clone BADrUL131r-Y4 that was used to produce infectious virus has been described previously [20] . The HCMV clinical strain TR has been previously described [14] . HCMV virus stocks were prepared by infecting nHDF cells with 0 . 1 PFU/cell and the cells or culture supernatant was harvested at 10\u201315 days post-infection . Extracellular virions were concentrated from infected cell supernatants by ultracentrifugation through a 20% ( wt/vol ) sorbitol cushion at 80 , 000\u00d7g for 1 . 5 hrs .

For IPs involving extracellular virions , virions were produced and purified from 10 day infected nHDFs as described above except that virion pellets were solubilized in 1% NP-40 . Construction and production of non-replicating ( E1- ) adenovirus ( Ad ) vectors expressing HCMV gB , gH , gL , mutant or tagged versions of HCMV gB have been described previously [18 , 24 , 32 , 33] . Ad vectors expressing HSV-1 gH/gL , gB , and gD , and nectin-1 were constructed as described previously [15 , 34] . Ad vectors were used to transduce cells at 10\u201350 PFU/cell . Ad vectors that contained HCMV genes that were regulated by promoters activated by the tetracycline trans activator protein were co-transduced into cells along with the Ad vector , Ad-tet-trans that expresses the tet-trans activator protein [35] .

The polyclonal HCMV gB anti-serum was produced in rabbits at OHSU using the soluble recombinant gB4M [19] according to standard protocols [19 , 46] . Anti-gB MAbs , 9C1 , 13H10 , and 15H7 were made at the OHSU monoclonal antibody core facility with mice injected with soluble gB4M . Anti FLAG M2 MAb was from Sigma . The rabbit polyclonal antibody to calnexin ( SPA-865 ) was obtained from Stressgen . Ad-transduced or HCMV infected cell monolayers or purified HCMV virus particles were solubilized in Tris-buffered saline ( TBS ) ( 50mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl ) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 ( NP-40 ) , transferred to microfuge tubes and incubated on ice for 10 min . Non-soluble material was removed by centrifuging lysates for 5 min at 12 , 000\u00d7g in a microcentrifuge . Lysates were incubated in primary antibody for 4 hrs or overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by incubation with protein-A agarose for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C . Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation at 500\u00d7g , washed 3 times with TBS containing 1% NP-40 and eluted in sample loading buffer ( 50mM Tris-pH 6 . 8 , 10% glycerol and 2% SDS ) with or without 1% 2-mercaptoethanol . Precipitated proteins were separated using standard SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and then electro-transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes . Electrophoresis of gM was performed using polyacrylamide gels containing 3M urea as previously described [39] . Membranes were incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% Tween-20 ( TBST ) containing 5% non-fat milk , washed , followed by incubation in TBST with primary antibodies for 1hr or overnight at 4\u00b0C . Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min in TBST and incubated in TBST with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1h . Lysates of gH/gL expressing ARPE-19 cells were derived from cells transduced with Ad vectors expressing gH/gL as described above . Cells were solubilized in 1% NP-40 buffer and the total protein concentration of the lysate was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay . Proteins were detected by incubating membranes in chemiluminescent reagent ( Perkin Elmer ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and imaged with an Imagequant LAS 4000 system ( GE Healthcare ) . The density of bands on western bots was quantified using ImageJ software or Image studio ( Licor ) . Ad-transduced or transfected cell monolayers were washed in PBS and then incubated for 20 min . in starve media consisting of cysteine/methionine free DMEM containing 2% dialyzed FBS and 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 . The media was then replaced with fresh starve media supplemented with 100\u03bcCi/ml 35S ( Express Protein labeling mix , Perkin Elmer ) . Cells were labeled for 4 hrs , collected , and solubilized in IP buffer containing 1% NP-40 , 1% digitonin , or 1% octyl glucoside . For pulse-chase labeling , Ad-transduced cells in 10 cm plates were removed from the plates with trypsin and washed twice in starve media . Cells from each plate were transferred into two microfuge tubes and incubated in 250 \u03bcl starve media for 2 hrs . The media was then exchanged with 250 \u03bcl of starve media supplemented with 1mCi/ml 35S Express Protein labeling mix . Cells were labeled for 15 min . and then the radioactive cysteine/methionine chased out by addition of DMEM with 10% FBS and 10-fold excess nonradioactive methionine and cysteine ( chase media ) . Cells were then incubated in chase media before being collected at different time-points . Lysates from labeled cells were used for immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above . Mutant gH and gL molecules were generated by using an overlapping oligonucleotide-directed site-specific strategy with a standard two-step PCR protocol with TR gH and gL gene sequences as templates . Linear sequences encoding 2\u20135 amino acids were replaced with the same number of alanines . An oligonucleotide was also used to add a FLAG epitope ( DYKDDDDK ) tag onto the C-terminus of the gH open reading frame . The modified gL and gH gene sequences were cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA 3 . 1+ , or pSPORT6 ( Invitrogen ) , respectively , and sequence verified . gH and gL plasmids along with a pSPORT6 plasmid expressing TR gB were used to transfect 293T cells . A total of 2 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA was transfected into one well of a 6-cell culture dish of 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) for 48 hrs then lysed in 1% NP-40 and the cell extracts subjected to IP with an anti-FLAG MAb and IP of gH/gL and gB analyzed by SDS-PAGE .", "prediction": "Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a ubiquitous virus that is a", "reference": "Like all herpesviruses , HCMV expresses two envelope proteins , gH/gL and gB that are essential for entry .

The impact of Nrf2 activation on human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection has not been tested . Sulforaphane ( SFN ) , produced in cruciferous vegetables after mechanical damage , mobilizes Nrf2 to potently reprogram cellular gene expression . Here we show for the first time that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells . Similarly SFN blocks infection in PMA-differentiated promonocytic cell lines , but not in other cell lines tested . siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf2 boosted HIV infectivity in primary macrophages and reduced the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment . This supports a model in which anti-viral activity is mediated through Nrf2 after it is mobilized by SFN . We further found that , like the type I interferon-induced cellular anti-viral proteins SAMHD1 and MX2 , SFN treatment blocks infection after entry , but before formation of 2-LTR circles . Interestingly however , neither SAMHD1 nor MX2 were upregulated . This shows for the first time that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection and highlights a novel way to trigger this inhibition .\nHighly active anti-retroviral treatment ( HAART ) is saving countless lives , however its application is accompanied by high financial costs , the emergence of resistant viruses and short- and long-term side-effects . A better understanding of how to activate cellular anti-viral defenses promises new therapeutic alternatives to overcome these limitations and to support prevention and cure strategies . Here we show for the first time that sulforaphane ( SFN ) , a natural product recognized for its health benefits , blocks HIV infection in macrophages . These cells play a critical role in HIV infection and pathogenesis , forming long-lived viral reservoirs [1 , 2] and carrying virus into restricted compartments like the brain [3] . Most monocytes , precursors of macrophages , are largely refractory to HIV infection until they differentiate to replenish the macrophage pool [4 , 5] . A small but specific subset of these cells however may be readily infectable , even in HAART-treated patients [6\u20139] . Infected macrophages have been observed in asymptomatic , untreated patients [10] and in HAART-treated individuals [11] . Other work , while not directly probing infection in situ , shows that rectal and vaginal macrophages share markers with HIV-susceptible macrophages [12 , 13] . Importantly , macrophages can powerfully increase T cell infection [14] and may thereby exacerbate T cell depletion in infected individuals . SFN is generated in cruciferous vegetables after mechanical damage , like chewing , causes admixing of glucoraphanin with the enzyme myrosinase . It reaches various tissues after consumption where it maintains biological function [15] . In humans SFN is absorbed in the gut and peak plasma levels are achieved within 90 minutes [16] . In mice SFN can reach the prostate after ingestion [17 , 18] where biological activity is maintained [19\u201321] . SFN is a powerful mobilizer of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) [22\u201324] . Nrf2 , a master regulator of the antioxidant response [25 , 26] , is held in check by its constitutive degradation through CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complexes using the protein KEAP1 as a substrate adaptor . SFN and other Nrf2-activators modify KEAP1 to prevent engagement of Nrf2 [27] . As Nrf2 accumulates , it translocates into the nucleus , partners with musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein ( Maf ) and initiates transcription from antioxidant response elements ( ARE ) . The consensus Nrf2 binding motif , TGACTCAGCA , was derived from known anti-oxidant response genes and Nrf2 binding was reconfirmed in chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcription analyses [28] . Nrf2 activates several types of genes [29] which predominantly encode proteins that counter oxidizing conditions [30] . Three viruses , Marburg virus [31 , 32] Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) [33] and Dengue virus [34] trigger Nrf2 activation . KSHV and Dengue virus appear to cause Nrf2 mobilization indirectly . Marburg virus however boosts Nrf2 levels directly with a protein designated VP24 . This protein assembles with Keap1 to , like SFN , hamper engagement of Nrf2 and thus Nrf2 turnover [31 , 32] . All three viruses benefit from increased Nrf2 expression [31\u201334] . The impact of SFN and Nrf2 on HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection , in primary cells , has not been determined . Here we show that SFN , acting through Nrf2 , triggers a strong block against HIV infection in myeloid-derived cells including primary macrophages , but not in primary T cells . SFN blocks infection after reverse transcription but before the formation of 2-LTR circles . Together this work shows that , in contrast to Marburg , Dengue and KSHV , HIV is blocked through Nrf2 and sets the stage for discovering the mechanism underlying this restriction .\nSFN , in various contexts , has been found to impair bacteria , fungi and even viruses including Influenza A , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) and Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) [35\u201339] . The impact of SFN on HIV infection however has not been tested in primary immune cells . Here , primary T cells were mock-treated or treated with 10 \u03bcM , 20 \u03bcM or 30 \u03bcM SFN for 24 hours . AZT-treated cells ( 5 \u03bcM ) served as positive controls for infection inhibition . Cultures were infected with identical aliquots of VSV-G pseudotyped env ( \u2012 ) HIV-1 luciferase reporter virus and harvested the following day . Cell lysates were tested for luciferase activity to quantify transcription from proviral DNA . While AZT suppressed infection , SFN did not impact infection throughout the dosage range tested ( Fig 1A ) . Dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) , a compound used to treat psoriasis and a known Nrf2 activator , slows HIV-1 spread in primary human monocyte derived macrophage ( hMDM ) cultures [40] . These experiments did not reveal how DMF interferes with HIV , but suggested to us that SFN could impact HIV infection in macrophages . This prompted us to test whether SFN blocks hMDM infection in single-round infection assays . Cells were mock treated or treated with 10 \u03bcM , 20 \u03bcM or 30 \u03bcM SFN for 24 hours as before . AZT-treated cells ( 5 \u03bcM ) served as positive controls for infection inhibition . One day after infection with VSV-G pseudotyped reporter virus , culture lysates were assayed for luciferase activity . Here , unlike in primary T cell cultures , luciferase activity dropped sharply in cultures treated with 10 \u03bcM SFN and fell to background levels with higher SFN concentrations ( Fig 1B ) . Thus , SFN acts to block single-round HIV-1 infections in primary hMDMs but not in primary T cells . To gain a better understanding of the breadth of SFN anti-viral action , we tested HeLa , GHOST and HEK293T cells , as well as monocytoid U937 and THP1 cells that were differentiated into a macrophage-like state by incubation in PMA-supplemented media . The cells were pretreated for 24 hours , then infected and assayed as described above . We detected no inhibition of HIV infection after SFN treatment in HeLa , HEK293T or GHOST cells ( Fig 2A\u20132C ) but SFN markedly decreased evidence of infection in U937 and THP1 cultures ( Fig 2D and 2E ) . Further titration of SFN in cultures of PMA-differentiated THP1 cells shows that infections can be reduced by 50% when cultures are treated with SFN in the 2 . 5 to 5 \u03bcM range ( Fig 2F ) . U937 cells do not produce detectable levels of SAMHD1 , an anti-viral protein that is expressed and active in PMA-differentiated THP1 cells and in hMDMs [41] . HeLa and HEK293T cells express SAMHD1 , but its anti-viral function is inactivated by cell cycle kinase-mediated phosphorylation [42] . Here we asked whether SAMHD1 could be responsible for SFN-mediated anti-viral action in U937 cells . SFN blocks HIV replication in U937 cultures , albeit at higher concentrations than in those of primary macrophages or of THP1 cells ( Fig 2D versus 2E ) . This raised the possibility that SFN triggers SAMHD1 production in U937 cells to block infection . We immunoblotted lysates of mock- and SFN-treated U937 cells for SAMHD1 and found that while SAMHD1 was readily detected in THP1 lysates , it remained undetectable in U937 lysates under the conditions tested ( Fig 2G ) . This indicates that SFN does not block HIV by increasing SAMHD1 levels . Importantly , SFN does not appreciably affect the viability of the cell-types tested . In order to determine whether cytotoxicity contributes to the apparent anti-viral action of SFN , we assessed cellular dehydrogenase activity in the presence or absence of SFN . Primary hMDMs and T cells , HeLa , GHOST and HEK293T cells as well as PMA-differentiated U937 and THP1 cells were treated with SFN for 24 hours as indicated . The translation inhibitor blasticidin served as a positive control for toxicity . Blasticidin-treated cells all showed decreased dehydrogenase activity; SFN however did not reduce dehydrogenase activity in most of the cell types tested . A slight reduction in dehydrogenase function was seen in THP1 cells at the higher concentrations tested ( S1 Fig ) . Overall these data indicate that SFN mediated impairment of HIV infection is not due to decreased cell viability as indicated by sustained metabolic activity . SFN treatment could cause changes in cells that continue to impact HIV infection long after treatment . To address this possibility we tested the durability of the SFN-mediated anti-viral state in THP1-derived macrophages . All replicate cultures were treated with SFN for 24 hours . The SFN-containing media was then replaced with SFN-free media and new sets of cultures were exposed to freshly thawed aliquots of the same virus stock at 24-hour intervals . Each set of cultures was harvested for luciferase assays 24 hours after infection ( Fig 3A ) . We found that infectability recovered over time in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 3B ) with higher doses of SFN yielding a longer-lasting infection block . After removal from 10 \u03bcM SFN , cultures were as infectable as mock-treated controls in about 24 hours . These data show that the anti-viral effect induced by SFN treatment is reversible and that the SFN dose determines the duration over which the anti-viral state is maintained . Here we tested whether SFN also impairs HIV-2 infection and whether SFN action is reporter-dependent . Cells were mock treated , or pretreated with vehicle , 5 \u03bcM AZT or 10 \u03bcM SFN , as indicated , and infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 or HIV-2 encoding luciferase in place of nef or with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 or HIV-2 encoding GFP in place of nef . Luciferase activity was measured in culture lysates and the percentage of GFP ( + ) cells was determined using flow cytometry . The loss of luciferase signal after SFN treatment in HIV-2-infected cultures paralleled that in the HIV-1-infected cultures ( Fig 4A versus 4B ) . The decrease in the percentage of GFP ( + ) cells upon AZT or SFN treatment was also the same in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected cultures ( Fig 4A and 4B versus 4C and 4D ) . These results demonstrate that our observations , showing an SFN-mediated infection block , are not reporter-dependent . The similarity between the results for HIV-1 and HIV-2 further indicate that SAMHD1 is not responsible for the block because HIV-2 Vpx would be expected to at least partially overcome that restriction . The results also support a model , based on our flow cytometry data with the GFP reporter virus , in which fewer cells are becoming infected after SFN treatment , rather than one in which a similar number of infected cells produce less reporter protein . We exploited the characteristics of VSV-G-pseudotyped , env ( \u2012 ) reporter viruses to determine that SFN pretreatment blocks infection at or before reporter production from integrated proviruses . Here we tested the impact of continuous SFN treatment on infections with the replication competent , reporter-free , dual-tropic HIV-1 strain HIV-1 89 . 6 [43] . Primary hMDMs were cultured in media containing DMSO , the vehicle for SFN , 5 \u03bcM AZT or 10 \u03bcM SFN . Culture supernatant samples were collected 3 , 6 , 9 and 14 days after infection and tested to determine the concentration of viral capsid protein , p24 . Both western blotting and antigen-capture ELISA were employed . The concentration of viral capsid in the cell supernatant increased steadily in the vehicle control , however in the AZT- and 10 \u03bcM SFN-treated samples it decreased from residual input levels to background levels ( Fig 5A and 5B ) . The HIV-1 89 . 6 Env glycoprotein can mediate fusion between adjacent macrophages , making inhibition of virus replication by SFN and AZT readily apparent in the cell cultures ( Fig 5C ) . Replicate cultures from these experiments were maintained in the presence of vehicle ( DMSO ) or 10 \u03bcM SFN for 14 days to determine the impact of SFN on cell health as measured by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity . Blasticidin-treated cultures served as positive controls for viability loss . Continuous SFN treatment did not reduce cellular dehydrogenase activity relative to the vehicle only control ( Fig 5D ) . Finally , we tested whether SFN also stops virus bearing HIV-1 89 . 6 envelope glycoprotein on its surface in single-round infections . This was of course to determine whether virus with an HIV-1 envelope also encounters a restriction that blocks viral gene expression . As in the other single-round infections , we generated virus by transfecting HEK293T cells with a plasmid expressing the env ( \u2012 ) luciferase reporter virus . Here , however we co-transfected with an HIV-1 89 . 6 envelope glycoprotein expression vector rather than one for VSV-G glycoprotein . As in the experiments with the VSV-G-pseudotyped virus , SFN significantly hindered infection with the HIV-1 89 . 6 envelope glycoprotein-pseudotyped virus ( Fig 5E ) . Overall , this set of experiments shows that SFN hinders both single-round and spreading infections . It further demonstrates that SFN interferes with infection of virus bearing the HIV envelope glycoprotein as it also interferes with VSV-G-pseudotyped virus . Finally , it also supports that our observation of SFN-mediated HIV inhibition is independent from exogenous reporter genes and shows that the SFN mediated block cannot be reversed by the Nef protein , which was absent from the luciferase and GFP reporter viruses . SFN acts through Nrf2 to execute the majority of its known functions [44\u201346] . We thus hypothesized that the SFN-mediated block to HIV infection also relies on Nrf2 . We first tested whether other known Nrf2 activators , dimethyl fumarate ( DMF ) and epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , also block HIV in single-round macrophage infections . DMF has been shown to temper spreading infections in primary macrophages [40] but its impact on single-round infections has not been tested . EGCG inhibits Tat-induced LTR transactivation in HeLa cell-derived MAGI cells [47] but was not tested in macrophages . EGCG has also been reported to block engagement of the CD4 receptor by HIV-1 gp120 [40 , 47 , 48] . Here we use VSV-G pseudotyped HIV for single round infections to avoid possible contribution of this effect to our investigation of the impact of Nrf2 on HIV infection . We found that like SFN , DMF and EGCG hinder reporter virus expression in single-round HIV-1 infections of PMA-differentiated THP1 cells and exhibit minimal toxicity ( Fig 6A\u20136C and S2A\u2013S2C Fig ) . This extends the previous work with DMF [40] by showing that the block is at a replication step at or before transcription from the provirus . Our observation that EGCG blocked VSV-G-pseudotyped virus eliminates the possibility that EGCG is thwarting a specific gp120/CD4 interaction in our system [48] . While we did not see SFN-mediated infection inhibition in HeLa cells ( Fig 2A ) we tested whether reporter expression from the provirus is inhibited by EGCG or the other compounds , as this could reflect inhibition of Tat function or transcription from the viral promoter . PMA-differentiated THP1 cells were pre-treated with AZT , DMSO , SFN , DMF or EGCG and then infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped luciferase reporter-encoding HIV-1 ( S3A Fig ) . Replicate cultures were infected with the same reporter virus and , 5 days later , treated for twenty-four hours with DMSO , AZT , SFN , DMF or EGCG . While pretreatment with AZT , SFN , DMF or EGCG significantly inhibited luciferase activity , treatment after infection had much less or no impact . This suggests that each compound is likely acting before transcription in THP-1 infections , although we cannot rule out some impact after integration , especially for SFN . Neither DMF nor EGCG suppressed reporter activity to the same degree as SFN in pretreated cultures , perhaps because SFN is one of the most potent naturally occurring Nrf2 activators [49\u201352] or because SFN may also have an additional , albeit smaller , impact after proviral integration . These observations prompted us to test directly whether SFN blocks HIV-1 through Nrf2 . To determine whether SFN requires Nrf2 to impair HIV infection of macrophages , we depleted primary hMDMs of Nrf2 with siRNA and assessed the impact of this treatment on infection with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 luciferase reporter virus , both in the presence and absence of 10 \u03bcM SFN . In the absence of SFN , depletion of Nrf2 caused a significant increase in luciferase activity indicating that Nrf2 is detrimental to HIV infection in macrophages and that the basal level of Nrf2 that is present in macrophages is sufficient for establishing some anti-viral activity ( Fig 6D ) . In cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA , SFN significantly reduced luciferase activity , reconfirming that SFN triggers a block to HIV infection of macrophages ( Fig 6D ) . SFN application , in combination with Nrf2-specific siRNA treatment , yielded a level of infectability that was lower than in the Nrf2-depleted , vehicle-treated cultures but higher than in cultures treated with non-targeting siRNA and SFN together . A western blot of parallel replicate cultures revealed that primary human macrophages express readily detectable quantities of Nrf2 ( Fig 6E ) . Specific siRNA transfection reduced Nrf2 protein levels , but SFN treatment restored Nrf2 expression to levels seen in untreated cultures . Thus , SFN partially counteracted the impact of Nrf2-specific siRNA . Importantly however , Nrf2 levels remained inversely proportional to infection levels even in the absence of SFN . This supports a model in which HIV infection is countered specifically through Nrf2 , and SFN acts to block HIV by increasing Nrf2 levels . If Nrf2 triggers expression of a protein or an RNA with anti-viral function , then we also expect levels of the Nrf2-dependent protein NQO1 to be inversely proportional to infectability . As expected in this scenario , NQO1 levels fell below constitutive quantities upon siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf2 and increased well above the base line in non-targeting siRNA-transfected cultures treated with 10 \u03bcM SFN . Consistent with our hypothesis , NQO1 levels in Nrf2-siRNA transfected cells returned to baseline upon treatment with 10 \u03bcM SFN ( Fig 6F ) . Thus infection of hMDMs appears to be Nrf2-dependent . The loss of Nrf2 and Nrf2 function , as reflected by Nrf2-dependent gene expression , enhanced reporter activity . Conversely , the gain of Nrf2 function reduced reporter activity . Overall these data are consistent with an Nrf2-dependent block to HIV infection in hMDMs that is enhanced , here , by SFN treatment . SFN blocks single-round HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections ( Fig 4 ) . This limits the Nrf2-mediated block to steps that extend from attachment of the virus to the cell through transcription from the provirus . We found that SFN counters infection whether viral entry is mediated through HIV Env or VSV-G glycoproteins ( Figs 1B versus 5E ) . This suggests a post-entry block as these glycoproteins engage different entry mechanisms . To further test whether SFN blocks after entry , we used real time PCR to quantify reverse transcription products in primary macrophage cultures infected in the presence or absence of SFN . We infected cells treated with vehicle , AZT or SFN with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 and quantified late reverse transcription products . Cultures exposed to the same quantity of heat-inactivated virus served to control for contamination of the viral stocks with the plasmid carrying the proviral clone used to generate the virus . The vehicle- and SFN-treated samples showed similar levels of late reverse transcription product , indicating that SFN , unlike AZT , did not hinder replication steps from viral entry through reverse transcription ( Fig 7A ) . When we tested for 2-LTR circles , non-productive infection by-products that correlate with the transport of viral preintegration complexes into the cell nucleus , we found that these were clearly decreased in the AZT and SFN samples relative to the vehicle controls ( Fig 7B ) . Alu-PCR , testing for integrated proviral sequences , also showed that these were similarly decreased in AZT- and SFN-treated cultures to levels that were significantly lower than in the vehicle-treated controls ( Fig 7C ) . Dengue virus infection , in monocyte-derived dendritic cells , activates the IRF3/7/STAT1 and NF-\u03baB anti-viral and inflammatory pathways , as well as Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes . Interestingly , silencing of Nrf2 with siRNA increased innate anti-viral responses linked to interferon treatment [34] . Our experiments , with HIV in macrophages , sharply contrast this trend . Specifically , boosting Nrf2 counters infection while Nrf2 depletion supports infection . The restriction that we observed however , after reverse transcription but before 2-LTR circle formation , parallels those imposed by the type I interferon-inducible proteins SAMHD1 and MX2 [53 , 54] . Here we asked whether SFN-mediated upregulation of Nrf2 protein levels causes an increase in the expression of those anti-viral proteins . We mock treated PMA-differentiated THP1 cultures or treated them with vehicle ( DMSO ) or 10 \u03bcM SFN , or with 500 U/mL of IFN\u03b1 . As expected , SFN significantly increased levels of Nrf2 as well as of the Nrf2-regulated genes NQO1 and GCLM ( Fig 8 ) . SFN did not significantly change levels of either SAMHD1 or MX2 . Conversely , IFN\u03b1 treatment increased levels of MX2 as expected . SAMHD1 levels , despite some donor-to-donor variation , did not change significantly in response to IFN\u03b1 , nor did the levels of Nrf2 , NQO1 or GCLM . Thus , in our system , we do not see an overlap in the set of proteins that are upregulated by SFN and those that are upregulated by IFN\u03b1 .\nHere we have , for the first time , shown that SFN stops HIV infection in primary macrophages by triggering a block to infection that impacts the virus after reverse transcription but before 2-LTR circle formation . The SFN-regulated restriction relies on Nrf2 , a transcription regulator of anti-oxidant genes . Importantly , we found that macrophages express sufficient Nrf2 to maintain a partial restriction even in the absence of SFN . This underscores that the anti-viral activity , while significantly enhanced by SFN through its augmentation of Nrf2 levels , does not require SFN to function . Our work showing that ( 1 ) SFN blocks macrophage infection mediated by either VSV-G or HIV-1 Env , ( 2 ) SFN does not block infection in all cell-types and ( 3 ) blocks replication after late reverse transcription products have been formed , all support a model in which the restriction is well after entry into the cell but likely before the viral pre-integration complex is imported into the cell nucleus . The lack of anti-viral SFN action in numerous cell types and the dependence in macrophages solely on Nrf2 also indicates that SFN is neither inhibiting HIV directly by modifying a viral component nor is it modifying and thereby inhibiting a cellular component that the virus needs for successful infection . Similarly it is unlikely that SFN is activating a protein , post-translationally , that blocks HIV directly . Our experiments comparing SFN action on GFP reporter virus with that on luciferase reporter virus further support a model in which the block is before the level of transcription . We used the GFP reporter virus to quantify individual infected cells and the fraction of those infected cells closely paralleled the population-wide reporter activity measured with the luciferase reporter virus . This indicates that the SFN-mediated block reduced the number of infected cells rather than suppressing transcription from similar numbers of infected cells . HIV-1 Tat was reported to increase Nrf2 levels in HeLa-derived MAGI cells which corresponded with decreased Tat-mediated HIV-1 LTR transactivation [47] . While we did not test MAGI cells , SFN did not detectably impact LTR-directed luciferase reporter expression in HeLa or other non-macrophage-like cells . Our finding that SFN strongly inhibits infection at or before 2-LTR formation could account for the entire SFN-mediated block however , based on data shown in S3 Fig , we cannot fully rule out the possibility that SFN also impacts transcription from virus that evaded the initial block . Our findings also put into perspective previous work that tested the neuroprotective effects of di- and monomethyl fumarate ( MMF ) . This study showed that DMF and MMF can attenuate spreading HIV infections in hMDMs [40] . Our work , employing single-round infections , allowed us to determine more specifically that DMF hinders a process before expression of new viral proteins . DMF and MMF , like SFN , increase levels of Nrf2 [55] , suggesting that these compounds also block HIV in macrophages through Nrf2 . Interestingly , in our experiments SFN blocked infections more effectively at lower concentrations than DMF did [40] . None of the genes known to be modulated by Nrf2 direct production of recognized anti-viral products [28] . It is however possible that Nrf2 initiates a different expression pattern in macrophages than it does in previously tested B lymphocyte-derived cell lines [28] . In considering gene expression changes that could occur in human macrophages after SFN treatment , our attention was drawn to work describing murine macrophages treated with oxidized phospholipids [56] . These cells , designated Mox , adopt an Nrf2-dependent phenotype that is distinct from that of both M1 and M2 macrophages . Like SFN treated B lymphocyte-derived cells [28] or the THP1 cells in our work , and unlike M1 macrophages , Mox cells do not upregulate expression of known anti-viral genes . SFN treatment , on the other hand , may elicit a transcription pattern distinct from that described for Mox cells as we observed increases in both GCLM and NQO1 ( Fig 8 ) while only GCLM was upregulated after treatment with oxidized phospholipids . Future experiments , measuring the infectivity of heterokaryons formed by fusing cells that block HIV in response to SFN and those that don\u2019t , will help to define the SFN-mediated block as a lack of a factor required for infection or the induction of a factor that blocks infection . This will help to guide the search for the mechanism underlying the SFN-mediated block . Presently however , the lack of HIV-associated factors among SFN-modulated genes is not surprising since new cellular anti-HIV factors and HIV co-factors continue to be identified [53 , 54 , 57\u201367] . We thus have discovered in SFN , a new way to activate an anti-viral state that HIV may not have previously encountered . It is therefore unlikely that the virus has developed an effective countermeasure . SFN , and other Nrf2 stimulators , could be used therapeutically to block HIV infection of macrophages and possibly of other important HIV targets . The capacity to hinder both HIV-1 and HIV-2 provides an advantage over several protease inhibitors as well as the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide and first generation non-nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitors which only block HIV-1 [68] . Further investigation will be required to determine why SFN fails to block infection in T cells , whether the same pathway could be exploited there as well or whether the restriction can be activated directly by other means . Drugs based on their electrophilic potential , like SFN , have been widely used . These include \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [69] and drugs that generate electrophilic intermediates through metabolism like the heartburn medicine omeprazole , or clopidogrel which is used against strokes and heart attacks [70\u201374] . Afatanib , another such drug , was approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung cancer [75] . Beloranib , also an agent with an electrophilic center , is in trials for the treatment of obesity [76] . The isothiocyante group of SFN can be replaced with other groups to further optimize this compound as a therapeutic agent [77] . Work in this regard has shown that substituting the sulfoxide group of SFN with a ketone group resulted in a compound that retained the biological activity of SFN itself [78] . Finally , the discovery that Nrf2 mobilization counters HIV infection in macrophages stands in contrast with recent work showing that Marburg and Dengue virus as well as KSHV initiate and benefit from increased Nrf2 expression [30 , 32 , 34 , 41] . All four viruses share tropism for cells within the myeloid lineage but KSHV , Dengue and Marburg virus , unlike HIV , also share the capacity to infect endothelial cells [79\u201381] . The consequences of how HIV , KSHV and Marburg virus interface with Nrf2 may be a reflection of this tropism difference , especially if the putative Nrf2-regulated anti-viral defense is not active in endothelial cells .\nAll primary cells were obtained from de-identified donors at the University of Nebraska Medical Center under a category 4 exemption from consent procedures based on the anonymity of the donors .

We used SFN , abundant in cruciferous vegetables and often used as a dietary supplement , to activate Nrf2 . Here we show , for the first time , that in immune cells isolated from donor blood , SFN halts HIV infection in macrophages , but not in T cells . We further show that upon SFN treatment the virus is blocked after it has transcribed its RNA-encoded genome into DNA , but before this genetic material is inserted into host chromosomes . Importantly this block is indeed dependent on Nrf2 . Interestingly , Nrf2 does not activate recognized anti-viral genes . Thus , unlike viruses recently found to benefit from Nrf2 activation , HIV can be blocked by its activation .

This is exemplified by life-threatening reactivations of e . g . herpesviruses in individuals with impaired T-cell and/or iNKT cell responses . To allow lifelong persistence and virus production in the face of primed immunity , herpesviruses exploit immune evasion strategies . These include a reduction in viral antigen expression during latency and a number of escape mechanisms that target antigen presentation pathways . Given the plethora of foreign antigens expressed in virus-producing cells , herpesviruses are conceivably most vulnerable to elimination by cell-mediated immunity during the replicative phase of infection . Here , we show that a prototypic herpesvirus , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , encodes a novel , broadly acting immunoevasin , gp150 , that is expressed during the late phase of viral replication . In particular , EBV gp150 inhibits antigen presentation by HLA class I , HLA class II , and the non-classical , lipid-presenting CD1d molecules . The mechanism of gp150-mediated T-cell escape does not depend on degradation of the antigen-presenting molecules nor does it require gp150\u2019s cytoplasmic tail . Through its abundant glycosylation , gp150 creates a shield that impedes surface presentation of antigen . This is an unprecedented immune evasion mechanism for herpesviruses . In view of its likely broader target range , gp150 could additionally have an impact beyond escape of T cell activation . Importantly , B cells infected with a gp150-null mutant EBV displayed rescued levels of surface antigen presentation by HLA class I , HLA class II , and CD1d , supporting an important role for iNKT cells next to classical T cells in fighting EBV infection . At the same time , our results indicate that EBV gp150 prolongs the timespan for producing viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the viral life cycle .\nViruses are exceptionally well equipped to adjust processes in infected host cells to support their own replication and survival . Especially in persistent infections , they must withstand many layers of anti-viral activities exerted by the host immune system . Cell-mediated immunity , in particular that mediated by antigen ( Ag ) -specific T cells , is essential for elimination of virus-infected cells , reducing viral replication , and stimulating other immune effector functions . CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are activated by peptide Ags presented at the cell surface in the context of HLA class I and class II ( HLA I and II ) molecules , respectively . In contrast , invariant natural killer T ( iNKT ) cells , a subset of specialized T cells characterized by a semi-invariant T cell receptor ( TCR ) in combination with NK cell receptors , recognize lipid Ags presented by CD1d , a non-classical , non-polymorphic HLA molecule . Upon activation , iNKT cells secrete a vast array of polarizing cytokines and they can also directly exert cytotoxicity [1] . In addition to the anti-viral cytotoxic and helper T cells , a role for iNKT cells in providing protection against viral infection has more recently been appreciated [2] . Herpesviruses are widespread viruses that establish lifelong persistent infections in their host , even in the face of virus-specific immunity [3] . Within their large ( 125\u2013230 kb ) DNA genomes , herpesviruses encode functions essential for viral replication , yet many additional gene products are non-essential for propagation in vitro . Evidence is accumulating that the latter are required for establishment of the delicate balance between viral replication and host responses in vivo . Among these gene products are immune evasion molecules that frustrate the activation of cell-mediated immunity by thwarting Ag presentation . The fact that such gene products have been independently acquired and maintained by multiple members of the herpesvirus family throughout millions of years of coevolution with their host testifies to the importance of T cell activation in the control of herpesvirus infection [4] . In humans , the in vivo contribution of cell-mediated immunity to fighting viral infection is probably best demonstrated for Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . This \u03b3-herpesvirus was the first human tumor virus discovered [5] , being associated with malignancies such as Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma . EBV is carried by more than 90% of adults worldwide , mostly asymptomatically . When primary EBV infection occurs during adolescence or adulthood , it presents in more than 50% of cases as self-limiting infectious mononucleosis [6] , in which viral replication is eventually controlled by the EBV-specific immune response . This contrasts to patients with the primary immunodeficiency X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome ( XLP ) who develop an often fatal mononucleosis when infected by EBV [6] . XLP patients have a genetic defect leading to nonfunctional T and NK cells and the absence of iNKT cells [7 , 8] . In addition , EBV can cause life-threatening lymphomas when cell-mediated immunity is insufficient , for instance in transplantation or AIDS patients . Reconstitution of EBV-specific T cell immunity by adoptive transfer provides a cure for post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD ) [9] . PTLD and XLP thus occur in two distinct patient groups having in common that they lack sufficient cell-mediated immunity to control EBV infection . Like other herpesviruses , EBV has acquired ingenious strategies to escape elimination by cell-mediated immunity of the immunocompetent infected host . Among these , EBV downregulates its Ag expression in the latent stage of infection and exploits ( viral ) immune evasion gene products , in particular during its replicative phase , to interfere with immune activation [10] . In the early lytic phase , Ag presentation by HLA I is reduced by the concerted action of ( at least ) three EBV proteins: BNLF2a blocks antigenic peptide supply [11] , BILF1 diverts HLA I complexes away from the cell surface [12] , and the shutoff protein BGLF5 acts as an RNase that arrests synthesis of , for instance , HLA I , II , and CD1d [10] . Silencing expression of these early EBV proteins in B cells supporting productive infection yielded only partially rescued surface display of the Ag-presenting molecules [13 , 14] . This led to the hypothesis that EBV encodes additional immune evasion molecules targeting CD1d , HLA I , and HLA II , but their identity has remained elusive . In this study , we took a global look at Ag presentation by EBV-producing B cells with a focus on the late phase of infection , when most Ags are expressed that could activate T and iNKT cell immunity . We identified the heavily glycosylated EBV protein gp150 , encoded by the BDLF3 gene , as a new viral immune evasion molecule . BDLF3 is unique to EBV and the closely related Rhesus lymphocryptovirus ( LCV ) . EBV gp150 interferes with immune recognition of HLA I , II , and CD1d/ Ag complexes at the cell surface . We provide evidence that gp150 shields the recognition of these surface molecules in a glycan-dependent manner . This represents a novel immune evasion mechanism in herpesviruses .\nTo study alterations in surface display of Ag-presenting molecules in the course of productive EBV infection of B cells , we employed our previously described EBV+ AKBM Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma ( BL ) system [15] . Following anti-human IgG treatment , cells supporting replication of EBV are identified in flow cytometry by expression of a lytic cycle reporter , rat CD2-GFP , and/or EBV lytic proteins , such as the gHgL complex ( Fig 1A , upper row ) . Surface display of the Ag-presenting molecules HLA I , II , and the non-classical HLA molecule CD1d is markedly reduced on EBV-producing cells in comparison to latently infected control cells ( Fig 1A , left panels ) , in line with our earlier reports [13 , 15] . Downregulation of surface HLA I complexes commenced around 8\u201310 hours post induction of the lytic cycle [15] , preceding that of HLA II and CD1d . Surface levels of the latter were progressively reduced on EBV-producing cells with a delay of about 4\u20136 hours compared to HLA I ( S1A Fig and [15] ) . To distinguish the contributions of late versus ( immediate- ) early EBV proteins to the downregulation of surface Ag-presenting molecules , phosphonoacetic acid ( PAA ) was used to arrest viral replication at the early phase . Upon anti-human IgG treatment of AKBM cells in the presence of PAA , late EBV protein expression of , for instance , gHgL complexes was inhibited , while the early rat CD2GFP reporter was still expressed ( Fig 1A , upper row ) . At the surface of PAA-treated cells , CD1d and HLA II levels were mostly retained ( Fig 1A , right panels ) , pointing towards involvement of late EBV protein ( s ) in T and iNKT cell immune evasion . HLA I downregulation was partly rescued upon PAA treatment indicating that , next to the early EBV proteins previously identified , also viral late proteins play a role in reducing the surface levels of HLA I ( Fig 1A , right panels ) . In conclusion , one or several of the 30 late EBV proteins interfere with surface display of the CD1d , HLA I , and HLA II Ag-presenting molecules . To identify the late EBV gene product ( s ) responsible for interference with Ag presentation observed during productive infection , we took the approach of expressing individual , or combinations of late viral genes in 293T-CD1d cells through plasmid transfection ( Fig 1B and 1C ) and/or in MJS-CD1d cells via lentiviral transduction ( Figs 1D and S1 ) . Screening of late EBV genes in 293T-CD1d cells revealed that most glycoproteins did not affect surface levels of CD1d ( Fig 1B ) , HLA I , or the control protein transferrin receptor ( TfR ) to a major extent ( S1B Fig ) . Also expression of EBV gB did not target CD1d , even though its homologue in herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) was found to act in concert with the viral kinase US3 to mediate intracellular retention of CD1d molecules observed during HSV-1 infection [16] . EBV gp350 caused some downregulation of CD1d , yet the strongest effect was observed for gp150 , encoded by the BDLF3 gene ( Fig 1B ) . Expression of EBV gp150 at levels comparable to those observed in virus-producing B cells ( Fig 1C , left panels ) resulted in marked downregulation of both Ag-presenting molecules tested ( upper panels ) , which was not evident in control transfected cells . The dot plots show an apparent threshold to gp150 levels resulting in loss of HLA I and CD1d detection . These combined data demonstrate that expression of the BDLF3-encoded EBV gp150 reduces the detection of HLA I and CD1d at the cell surface . Finally , we determined whether the timing of gp150 expression during productive EBV infection of human B cells would match the observed downregulation of Ag-presenting molecules . To visualize total gp150 protein levels in the course of EBV reactivation in B cells , we used an antibody ( Ab ) directed against its intracellular cytoplasmic tail [19] . Whereas the early EBV protein BGLF5 was detectable from 4 hours post induction [15] onwards , no gp150 protein was found before 8\u201310 hours into lytic infection with clear detection from 12 hours onwards ( Fig 1D ) , leaving enough time to influence HLA I , II , and CD1d expression at late times . These combined data point to gp150 interfering with surface detection of Ag-presenting molecules on EBV-producing B cells . Since no function had hitherto been ascribed to the EBV glycoprotein gp150 , its role in immune evasion of Ag-presenting molecules was further investigated . To study gp150\u2019s phenotype and mechanism of action in more detail , we expressed the EBV protein in MJS-CD1d cells via lentiviral transduction , together with GFP as a marker for successful transduction . This approach was validated with known EBV evasion molecules [11 , 17 , 18] that specifically reduced surface display of HLA I ( BNLF2a and BILF1 ) or HLA II ( gp42gHgL ) . At the same time , this experiment showed that the known EBV T cell immunoevasins did not interfere with CD1d expression ( S2A Fig ) . HLA I and CD1d downregulation from the GFP+ MJS-CD1d-gp150 cells ( Figs 2A and S2B ) indicated that this immune evasive phenotype was not limited to transient overexpression in 293T cells ( Fig 1 ) . Furthermore , gp150 downregulated surface levels of HLA II and also affected other molecules such as CD10 , CD54 ( Fig 2A ) , and TfR ( S2B Fig ) . To allow easier comparison of gp150\u2019s effects on various cell surface markers , we calculated the difference in logarithmically transformed mean fluorescence intensities ( \u0394log MFI ) for each surface marker to serve as a measure for the extent of gp150-mediated downregulation , by subtracting the log MFI values for cells that were non- ( GFP- ) or successfully ( GFP+ ) transduced with either gp150-IRES-GFP or a control GFP lentivirus ( Fig 2B right panel; the left panels show examples of the log MFI for CD1d and CD54 ) . This approach visualized that the antigen-presenting molecules HLA I , II and CD1d were more sensitive to EBV gp150 downregulation than the CD10 and CD54 molecules ( Fig 2B ) . To investigate if gp150\u2019s effects reflect level-dependency , we transduced MJS-CD1d cells with a range of lentivirus amounts to achieve decreasing levels of gp150 expression . This resulted in a concomitant reduction in surface downregulation of the cellular proteins tested ( S2C Fig ) . When using the higher dose of gp150 lentiviruses in the adherent MJS-CD1d cells , we observed that a proportion of cells detached from the culture dish by 3 days after transduction . This detachment did not only occur as a consequence of lentiviral transduction or of gross gp150-induced cytotoxicity ( see S3A Fig ) . Loss of attachment of the gp150high GFPhigh cells coincided with a further reduced surface detection of HLA I , II , and CD1d ( compare Figs 2A and S3B ) . Very high levels of gp150 even downregulated the cell surface molecules CD10 and CD54 , which were only marginally affected in the adherent cell fraction ( Figs 2A and S3B ) . These results\u2014together with the apparent threshold for gp150-induced downregulation ( dot plots in Figs 1C and 2A ) and the dose-dependent effect of gp150 expression ( S2C Fig ) \u2014demonstrate that higher levels of gp150 cause a stronger phenotype . Thus , EBV gp150 acts in an expression level-dependent manner to downregulate multiple cell surface molecules , to different extents . Finally , to obtain an impression of the target range of gp150 , we looked for surface molecules on MJS-CD1d cells that were not downregulated by the EBV protein . We found that virtually equal levels of CD34 , CD44 , and CD55 were detected on cells that did or did not express gp150 , even when gated on the GFPhigh fractions of cells ( Fig 2C ) . From these data we conclude that various cell surface molecules display differential sensitivity to EBV gp150 , with CD34 , CD44 , and CD55 as examples of proteins that are resistant ( Fig 2 ) . Since gp150 has a strong effect on the Ag-presenting molecules HLA I , II , and CD1d , this EBV glycoprotein appears to be a broadly acting immune evasion molecule . Next , we intended to determine the functional consequences of EBV gp150-induced immune evasion . Reduced surface HLA I , II , and CD1d levels were detected with Abs that are capable of blocking many TCR\u2013HLA/Ag interactions ( Figs 1 and 2 ) , pointing towards functional relevance of gp150\u2019s blocking activity . To assess if EBV gp150 expression in Ag-presenting cells affects T cells activation , the capacity of HLA-A2+DR3+ MJS-A2 cells to induce interferon ( IFN ) -\u03b3 production was monitored with well-defined T cell clones with different specificities . Activation of CD8+ T cells specific for a human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) pp65 epitope presented in the context of HLA-A2 was analysed after stimulation with pp65-expressing MJS-A2 cells that did or did not co-express EBV gp150 ( Fig 3A ) . Whereas GFP+ control cells efficiently activated the T cells , IFN-\u03b3 production was markedly reduced in T cells cultured with gp150-expressing Ag-presenting cells ( Fig 3A ) . The use of another T cell clone , a CD4+ T cell directed against a minor histocompatibility Ag ( MiHa ) endogenously expressed by MJS cells and presented in the context of HLA-DR3 , allowed us to study inhibition of T cell responses restricted by HLA II . Diminished secretion of IFN-\u03b3 by the T-helper cells was observed in response to cells expressing gp150 compared to control cells ( Fig 3B ) . These results show that not only detection of Ag-presenting molecules by Ab was blocked by gp150 , but also T cell activation was hampered . T cell activation upon target cell engagement involves formation of multiple receptor-ligand pairs , including TCR\u2013HLA/Ag as well as costimulatory and adhesion molecule interactions . In view of the broader target range of EBV gp150 , it could diminish multiple of these interactions . Here , we zoomed in on the effect of gp150 on MHC/peptide\u2013TCR interactions . To this end , human 293T cells were used that express the mouse MHC molecule H-2Kb to present the ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL epitope . Display of SIINFEKL-loaded Kb molecules at the cell surface was detected with the 25D1 . 16 Ab , thereby recapitulating TCR binding ( Fig 3C ) . Upon introduction of EBV gp150 into these cells , a significant reduction in surface levels of epitope-loaded Kb molecules was observed ( Fig 3C and 3D ) . This further supports the conclusion that T cell activation is diminished upon gp150-induced downregulation of surface Ag-presenting complexes . Our combined results indicate that EBV gp150 impairs Ag presentation to both HLA I- and II-restricted T cells . Having demonstrated the functional impact of gp150-induced T cell evasion , we wanted to unravel its mechanism of action . In the remainder of these studies , we focused on the adherent fraction of gp150-expressing cells , although the effects might even be stronger for floating cells . In addition , we made use of constructs that encode gp150 with an N-terminal HA-tag ( Fig 4A ) to allow visualisation of the proportion of this EBV molecule expressed at the cell surface . First , we investigated if reduced surface display of Ag-presenting molecules was due to gp150-induced protein degradation . Degradation of HLA molecules either by proteasomes residing in the cytoplasm or by endolysosomal proteases is an evasion strategy exploited by a number of herpesviruses , for instance by HCMV and by Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus [4] . For EBV gp150-induced effects , however , no difference in surface levels was observed for HLA I or CD1d in the presence either of the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin or of chloroquine , an inhibitor of the endolysosomal degradation pathway ( Fig 4B ) . Of note , HA-gp150 molecules arrived at the cell surface , irrespective of treatment with these inhibitors . Additionally , intracellular staining with the D5 Ab , which detects free CD1d heavy chains ( not associated with \u03b22m ) [20] , revealed no reduction in this intracellular population of CD1d molecules in the presence of gp150 ( Fig 4B , right panels ) , suggesting that gp150 does not induce degradation of newly synthesized CD1d molecules . In an alternative approach , we compared gp150\u2019s effect on surface display directly to that on total cellular levels of HLA I in the form of an N-terminally eGFP-myc-tagged HLA-A2 molecule [21] , which was introduced into the HLA-A2- cell line MJS ( MJS-GFPmycA2 cells ) . In the non-permeabilized cells , GFP fluorescence reflected total levels of this fusion protein and , at the same time , surface levels were visualized with Abs directed to the extracellular myc-tag or HLA-A2 epitope ( BB7 . 2 ) . High levels of BB7 . 2 and anti-myc Ab staining as well as GFP fluorescence were detected in MJS-GFPmycA2 cells by flow cytometry ( Fig 4C , non-transduced cells ) , indicating that the HLA-A2 fusion protein was properly expressed and reached the cell surface . Upon subsequent introduction of HA-gp150 , we observed a strong reduction in surface detection of the chimeric HLA-A2 molecule , whereas total GFP levels remained unaffected ( Fig 4C , gp150+ cells ) . These data implicate that in gp150-expressing cells total levels of HLA molecules remain unaltered , yet their surface detection is reduced . In the same experimental set-up , we studied which part ( s ) of gp150 are essential for immune evasion . EBV gp150 is a type I membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail ( Fig 4A ) . Some herpesvirus proteins , such as EBV BILF1 , depend on their cytoplasmic tail for interference with Ag presentation [22] . As deletion of 26 amino acids from the C-terminus of gp150 ( HA-gp150\u0394C ) did not impair the apparent downregulation of HLA I ( endogenous and A2-GFP; Fig 4C , lower panels ) or of CD1d from the cell surface , we conclude that the immune evasion function of gp150 is independent of its cytoplasmic tail . The combined data obtained upon protease inhibitor treatment and with the GFPmycA2 fusion protein demonstrate that gp150 does not promote degradation of Ag-presenting molecules as an immune evasive strategy . Although the Ag-presenting molecules were not degraded in gp150+ cells , they were not detectable at the cell surface either . Therefore , we probed the intracellular location of these molecules both in gp150-expressing cells and controls . As trafficking of newly synthesized glycoproteins from the ER onwards is reflected by the progressive maturation of their glycans , we compared the migration of the CD1d and HLA I heavy chains in Western blots using lysates of sorted populations of control and gp150-transduced cells ( non-transduced , vector , and gp150low/high , respectively; see S4 Fig ) . Differentially glycosylated maturation forms of these Ag-presenting molecules were identified upon glycosidase treatment . Endoglycosidase H ( Endo H ) removes high-mannose N-linked glycans , but not complex glycans that arise after the transport of glycoproteins beyond the cis-Golgi compartment . Peptide N-glycosidase F ( PNGase F ) treatment reveals the deglycosylated protein backbone , as it removes all N-linked glycans regardless of their maturation . Mature CD1d heavy chains carry 4 N-linked glycans , three of which become Endo H-resistant and one of which remains Endo H-sensitive [23] . In untreated control cells , two CD1d bands were detected that probably reflect different glycosylation stages of CD1d ( Fig 5A , +CHO , lanes 1 and 4 ) . PNGase F treatment resulted in one dominant band and a very faint band , reflecting virtually complete deglycosylation of CD1d heavy chains ( -CHO , lanes 3 and 6 ) . Endo H treatment revealed the deglycosylated CD1d heavy chain ( -CHO , lanes 2 and 5 ) ; the two additional bands represent Endo H-resistant heavy chains , showing that these CD1d molecules have travelled beyond the cis-Golgi . The HLA I heavy chain carries a single N-linked glycan and only one band is observed in untreated control cell lysates ( lanes 1 and 3 ) , which is removed upon digestion with both PNGase F ( lanes 3 and 6 ) and Endo H ( lanes 2 and 5 ) . Only a minor fraction of the HLA I molecules apparently becomes Endo H-resistant in these MJS cells . The pattern of maturation forms of CD1d and HLA I in gp150+ cells was virtually identical to that observed in control cells ( compare lanes 1\u20136 to 7\u201312 ) . If anything , the mature , Endo H-resistant heavy chains were more prominent in gp150+ cells . From these data , we conclude that the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of new HLA I and CD1d molecules is not inhibited in the presence of EBV gp150 . Furthermore , the presence of the heavily glycosylated viral protein in the ER does not appear to act as a \u201cglycosylation sink\u201d preventing the exit of newly synthesized Ag-presenting molecules . Confocal microscopy allows the visualisation of Ag-presenting molecules within the cell as well as their potential colocalization with EBV gp150 [22] . For these experiments , we employed non-permeabilized , non-fixed MJS cells expressing a C-terminal GFP fusion molecule of HLA-A2 ( A2GFP ) , which had been used before in microscopy studies on HLA I maturation and trafficking [24] . Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that this HLA-A2 fusion protein behaved similarly to the other Ag-presenting molecules tested . Introduction of gp150 in MJS-A2GFP cells decreased surface detection by HLA I-specific Abs , while GFP fluorescence indicated that the total amount of cellular A2GFP molecules was not altered by gp150 ( Fig 5B ) . In confocal microscopy , gp150+ MJS-A2-GFP cells were identified based on positive staining for the HA-tag attached to gp150 ( in red; Fig 5C , lower left panel ) , which confirmed that HA-gp150 molecules arrived at the cell surface . Focusing on the non-transduced ( HA- ) control cells , the GFP signal shows localization of A2GFP fusion proteins at the plasma membrane ( Fig 5C , upper right panel ) . Accordingly , the surface-exposed A2GFP molecules were detectable with Ab BB7 . 2 ( Fig 5C , upper left panel ) , yet only in the non-transduced fraction of cells . This costaining demonstrated the integrity of the chimeric HLA-A2 molecule . Using Ab-staining ( BB7 . 2 ) , surface A2GFP molecules were not detected on the gp150+ fraction of cells by confocal microscopy ( Fig 5C , upper left panel ) , as may have been anticipated from the flow cytometry data described above ( Figs 1 , 2 and 4 ) . However , GFP fluorescence revealed the presence of the A2GFP molecules also at the surface of gp150+ cells , where they colocalized with gp150 ( Fig 5C , right panels ) . The arrival of HLA I molecules at the surface of both gp150+ and control cells , indicates that gp150 does not alter the localization of these Ag-presenting molecules . Quantification of multiple microscopy pictures supports that the Ab-based detection of HLA-A2-GFP is significantly reduced for gp150-expressing cells compared to control cells and this was not due to reduced GFP fluorescence intensity at the cell surface ( Fig 5D ) . Together , these data indicate that cellular expression of EBV gp150 does not alter the total protein levels or localization of HLA molecules , but prevents their Ab-based detection on the cell surface . Since the cytoplasmic tail of gp150 is not essential for immune modulation , it is likely that the extracellular domain of gp150 is mechanistically involved . The most peculiar characteristic of EBV gp150 is its highly abundant glycosylation , with about half of the amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain being potential substrates for N- or O-linked glycosylation ( Fig 4A ) . Its extensive glycosylation is reflected by the observation that in SDS-PAGE gels , gp150 migrates as a diffuse band with a molecular weight of 100\u2013150 kDa , whereas the unglycosylated protein backbone is around 30 kDa [25 , 26] . Although the exact glycan composition is not known , gp150 carries many negatively-charged sialic acid moieties [25 , 26] . To directly assess whether the glycan decoration on gp150 plays a role in the shielding of surface Ag-presenting molecules , flow cytometry analysis was performed on gp150 expressing cells from which sialic acids had been depleted using three different approaches . First , we introduced human CD1d , HLA-A2 , and \u03b22m both into Lec2 cells , which are Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells with a mutated CMP-sialic acid Golgi transporter resulting in decreased sialylation of glycans [27] , and into control CHO cells . Defective sialylation in the Lec2 cells was confirmed by decreased binding of wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) , a lectin that binds sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine structures ( chitobiose ) ( Fig 6A ) . The effect of defective glycosylation on EBV gp150 expressed in Lec2 cells was visible by Western blot: compared to lysates from control CHO cells , gp150 from Lec2 cell lysates migrated at a higher apparent molecular weight , likely due to the absence of negatively charged sialic acids ( Fig 6B ) . Staining for surface HLA I and CD1d on Lec2 cells was somewhat increased compared to parental CHO cells , probably reflecting a better accessibility of the Ab binding sites when the Ag-presenting molecules are less sialylated ( Fig 6C and 6D ) . In the CHO cells , expression of EBV gp150 decreased HLA I and CD1d staining , which was partly reversed in Lec2 cells . This indicates that sialic acids contribute to the phenotype caused by gp150 ( Fig 6C and 6D ) . Second , to address the role of sialylation in protein downmodulation in human cells and , thereby , also to be able to test a broader panel of surface markers , sialylation was inhibited by pretreating MJS-CD1d cells with the fluorinated sialic acid analogue P-3Fax-Neu5Ac [28] . This analogue blocks sialyltransferases , enzymes that transfer sialic acids onto glycans . Inhibition of sialylation was detected by the reduced binding of the sialic acid-binding lectins SNAI and MALII to treated cells ( Fig 6E ) . Strongly enhanced binding of PNA , a lectin that binds to glycan structures that become accessible upon desialylation , further confirmed successful inhibition of sialyltransferases following cell culture in the presence of this competitive inhibitor ( Fig 6E ) . Similar to the sialylation-defective hamster cells , sialyltransferase inhibitor treatment of MJS-CD1d cells expressing gp150 was sufficient to cause the viral protein to migrate differently in SDS-PAGE ( Fig 6F ) . Cells transduced to express gp150 that were pre-incubated with P-3Fax-Neu5Ac showed increased surface staining for HLA I , II , and CD1d compared to control cells ( Fig 6G and 6H ) , consistent with a crucial role for sialylation in the shielding of Ab binding sites by gp150 . Third , to selectively cleave off cell surface sialic acids , we treated cells with neuraminidase . Enzymatic desialylation occurred in a dose-dependent fashion , as witnessed by progressive loss of WGA lectin binding at the cell surface ( Figs 6I and S5 ) . Selectivity of this neuraminidase treatment for surface-exposed glycans was supported by Western blot analysis , in which a proportion of gp150 molecules from treated cells displayed reduced mobility , whereas the remaining , likely intracellular , EBV proteins had an apparent molecular weight comparable to that in untreated cells ( Fig 6J ) . At the surface of gp150-transduced MJS-CD1d cells , CD1d detection improved with increasing doses of neuraminidase ( Figs 6K and S5 ) , pointing to a direct involvement of sialic acid-modified glycans in interference with CD1d detection . Likewise , surface display of the host cell molecules HLA I and HLA II was improved by neuraminidase treatment ( Fig 6K and 6L ) to the same range as observed for the inhibitor treatment ( Fig 6G and 6H ) , suggesting that primarily sialic acids at the cell surface played a role . In the three settings above ( Fig 6 ) , a rescue of 15\u201325% in the surface detection of Ag-presenting molecules was observed in the presence of desialylated versus fully sialylated gp150 . This rescue being modest is perhaps due to the remaining glycan structures on gp150 . Still , a highly significant increase in display was detected in all abovementioned experimental approaches . Therefore , these combined results provide evidence that surface sialic acid-carrying N- and O-linked glycans contribute to EBV gp150\u2019s ability to hide certain host cell surface molecules , including those involved in Ag presentation , thereby providing a mechanistic basis for T and iNKT cell evasion . Natural EBV infection in vivo targets human B cells and epithelial cells and the main reservoir of persistent infection is the memory B cell . To produce new offspring , EBV reactivates from latently infected B cells carrying the viral genome . Whereas the 293T and MJS cells could reflect epithelial infection , we specifically addressed the question if gp150-mediated immune evasion was also operative in human B cells . As relevant human B cells for this study , we chose Akata BL cells in latency , which upon induction are capable of supporting productive EBV infection , implying that all host cell factors essential for EBV replication are present . These Akata BL cells are the parental equivalent of the AKBM cells described above ( without the rat CD2GFP lytic cycle reporter ) . In the Akata BL background , Borza and Hutt-Fletcher [19] had previously generated a knockout mutant EBV that lacks the BDLF3 open-reading frame coding for gp150 ( Akata\u0394gp150 cells , see below ) . For immune evasion studies , we introduced a constitutively expressed EBV gp150 gene into these latent Akata\u0394gp150 B cells , thereby avoiding potential interference by any endogenous gp150 expression ( referred to as Akata+gp150 cells ) . To achieve gp150 expression at levels similar to those occurring in EBV-producing B cells , we compared gp150 protein levels in Akata cells transduced with HA-gp150 or HA-gp150\u0394C lentiviruses to those in lytically induced AKBM cells . In flow cytometry using an Ab against the gp150 C-terminus , levels of gp150 in productively infected B cells appeared to exceed those in cells transduced to express full-length gp150 in isolation ( Fig 7A , left panel ) . The C-terminally truncated gp150 lacks the epitope recognized by the anti-gp150 Ab . Therefore , we next compared full-length and truncated gp150 expression levels in transduced B cells by means of their HA-tag and found that levels of the cytoplasmic tailless gp150 were slightly higher than those of the full-length protein ( Fig 7A , right panel ) . Based on this , we reasoned that B cells expressing gp150\u0394C in isolation likely reflect the levels occurring in the context of natural EBV-infection of B cells and we have , therefore , studied these cells in more detail . Detection of HA-tag on non-permeabilized HA-gp150 Akata cells ( Fig 7B ) also shows that the gp150 protein arrives at the surface of B cells as it did on 293T ( Fig 1C ) and MJS ( Figs 2A , 4B and 4C , 5B and 5C ) cells . At the surface of HA-gp150\u0394C-transduced Akata B cells , detection of HLA I , II , CD1d , and to a lesser extent CD10 was reduced in comparison to untransduced control cells ( Fig 7B , upper panels ) . This shows that gp150 induces an immune evasive phenotype in human B cells as it did in the other cell types studied . Neuraminidase treatment of Akata+gp150 cells increased surface binding of Abs specific for the three Ag-presenting molecules and CD10 ( Fig 7B , lower panels and bar graphs ) , pointing towards direct involvement of sialic acids in gp150-induced shielding of B cell surface markers . These data combined with those in Fig 6 of gp150 masking surface HLA I , II , and CD1d via a glycan shield indicate that the same mechanism of action can operate both in epithelium-like cells and in B cells , the natural targets for EBV infection in vivo . To assess the contribution of gp150-mediated interference with Ag presentation in the full viral context , we studied the productive phase of infection in B cells that harbour either wild-type EBV ( Akata wt ) or the BDLF3 deletion mutant Akata\u0394gp150 . Based on the use of these cells , gp150 was earlier reported not to be essential for EBV replication in vitro , as the recombinant virus had no defects in binding , infectivity , assembly , or egress [19] . In line with this , we found no apparent differences in progression through the replicative cycle between lytically induced Akata wt and \u0394gp150 cells: both expressed the EBV immediate-early BZLF1 , early BGLF5 , and late gp350 proteins , but only Akata wt cells produced gp150 , as did control induced AKBM cells ( S6A Fig ) . To determine surface levels of the host cell molecules HLA I , II , CD1d , and CD10 by flow cytometry , both types of induced Akata cells were counter-stained for gp350 , to identify the EBV-producing B cells . As observed for AKBM cells ( Fig 1A ) , induction of the lytic cycle caused a downregulation of surface display of the Ag-presenting molecules HLA I , II , and CD1d in ( gp350+ ) Akata wt cells , when compared to the latently infected cells ( Fig 7C ) . In the absence of gp150 , however , HLA I , II , and CD1d surface levels were significantly higher during productive infection , as visible when comparing gp350+ Akata\u0394gp150 to Akata wt cells ( Fig 7C , compare tinted with non-filled grey histograms ) . Likewise , downregulation of the B cell surface markers CD10 and CD86 was less pronounced in lytic cells devoid of gp150 ( Fig 7C and S6B Fig ) . These results indicate that gp150 contributes to the apparent downregulation of Ag-presenting molecules and\u2013to a lesser extent- other surface markers in a model for natural EBV infection of human B cells . Our combined data support a model in which surface molecules , including Ag-presenting molecules , are shielded from recognition by the extensive glycosylation of gp150 , pointing towards a contribution of this novel EBV evasion molecule to interference with cell-mediated immunity against EBV ( Fig 8 ) .\nCell-mediated immunity by HLA I and II-restricted cytotoxic and helper T cells as well as by CD1d-restricted iNKT cells is critical in the defence against many viruses [1] . Especially persistent viruses , such as herpesviruses , have acquired strategies to permit their escape from elimination by these immune cells . In this study , we report that EBV infection , even in its late productive phase , substantially reduced display of CD1d , HLA I , and HLA II complexes at the surface of human B cells . Reduced detection of these antigen-presenting molecules was observed with Abs that can block TCR binding . This effect is functionally important , because HLA downregulation results in reduced T cell activation . For transmission to other target cells or hosts , new viral particles need to be produced through EBV reactivation from latently infected B cells , the primary natural targets for EBV infection . At the late stage of viral replication , up to 100 EBV genes are expressed , thus resulting in a wide array of Ags presented at the surface of infected cells to T cells . EBV-specific T cells are generated upon primary infection [6] . Therefore , immune escape strategies targeting Ag-presenting molecules including HLA I , II , and CD1d might allow EBV-producing B cells to effectively evade T and iNKT cell surveillance in vivo , prolonging the timespan for the production of viral offspring . Indeed , patients with reduced functional T and iNKT cell numbers are known to have life-threatening complications upon encountering EBV [6] . Our finding that gp150 acts as a novel EBV-encoded immune evasion molecule causing reduced detection of surface CD1d , HLA I , and HLA II complexes is intriguing as it is not only the first function ascribed to this viral glycoprotein , it also reveals a novel mechanism employed by herpesviruses to dodge immune recognition . In contrast to most herpesvirus structural glycoproteins , EBV gp150 was found to be non-essential for viral entry , assembly , or egress [19] and the function of this late viral protein has remained enigmatic until now . Here , we provide evidence in support of a model in which gp150 is able to shield surface HLA molecules , through its abundantly sialylated glycans , in order to escape T cell activation ( Fig 8 ) . Cellular expression of gp150 in isolation was sufficient to reduce detection of multiple cellular surface molecules , for example interfering with binding of an Ab detecting the H-2 Kb/SIINFEKL antigenic complex . Moreover , we show that B cells producing a gp150-deleted mutant virus display more Ag-presenting molecules as compared to wild-type EBV , indicating that gp150 contributes to immune evasion in the full viral context . EBV gp150 did not appear to promote degradation , retention , internalization , or altered glycosylation of HLA molecules . Rather , HLA molecules arrived at the cell surface , yet failed to be recognized , a defect which was restored in part by preventing sialylation . To date , only the Ebola virus glycoprotein ( EBOV GP ) has been described to shield host cell surface molecules , namely HLA I and \u03b21 integrin molecules , via its extensively glycosylated mucin-like domain [29] . This suggests that similar mechanisms have evolved independently in different viruses belonging to different families . Both EBOV GP\u2019s mucin-like domain and the ectodomain of EBV gp150 contain around 10 potential N-glycosylation and more than 70 potential O-glycosylation sites . The mucin-like domain of EBOV GP consists of mainly core 2 O-linked glycans [30] . The \u2018core\u2019 type of O-linked glycans on gp150 is , at present , unknown , but could also consist of core 2 glycans in view of its resistance to O-glycanase that removes core 1 and core 3 O-glycans [25] . Thus , it remains to be investigated whether the glycans of EBV gp150 and EBOV GP share key features or whether they evolved similarly to shield host surface molecules . Detailed characterization of the glycans of EBOV GP and EBV gp150 is likely required to fully comprehend the molecular necessities of viral glycoproteins to shield cell surface molecules and thereby facilitate further identification of such proteins . It would be interesting to know whether other ( herpes ) viruses have incorporated similar strategies to escape from immune recognition , as this would provide further insight into the significance and requirements of this mechanism . The BDLF3 ORF is also present in Rhesus LCV . Rhesus LCV BDLF3 protein displays only 46% amino acid homology to EBV gp150 , but shares the feature of the serine/threonine-rich ectodomain indicating that it too might be heavily glycosylated . In view of the low sequence homology between the BDLF3 proteins of these closely related \u03b3-herpesviruses , glycosylation potential rather than amino acid sequence might provide immune evasive properties . It will be interesting to analyse the immune evasive properties of MHV-68 ORF28 , the positional homologue of EBV BDLF3 . MHV-68 ORF28 also appears to be non-essential for viral replication in vitro and in vivo [31] . Compared to gp150 , the ectodomain of ORF28 is reduced in size , yet highly glycosylated and could therefore provide insights into the structural requirements for glycan shielding . It is tempting to speculate that other proteins or different ( herpes ) viruses present functional homologues of EBV gp150 and EBOV GP that do not share amino acid similarity , yet retain the feature of a heavily glycosylated extracellular domain . Intriguingly , we observed that the major envelope glycoprotein of EBV , gp350 , also interfered with surface detection of CD1d ( Fig 1B ) and TfR ( S2B Fig ) . Interestingly , not only do viruses appear to exploit a glycan shielding strategy , but also cancer cells show aberrant expression of sialic acid-modified glycans that are thought to play a role in tumor immune evasion [32] , which may in part be due to the reported sialylation-dependent inhibition of NK cells by masking ligands of activating NK cell receptors [33] . Relevance of sialylation-dependent immune interference by tumors is demonstrated by the fact that hypersialylation of tumor cells is associated with poor prognosis for patients [34] . Interestingly , when sialic acid decoration on tumor cells was inhibited with the same compound as we have used ( Fig 6E\u20136H ) , it resulted in reduced metastases in an in vivo mouse model [35] . Our results show a direct effect of gp150 on the presentation of antigenic peptides to T cells . In addition to Ag-presenting molecules , EBV gp150 could also affect the function of various other cell surface molecules . Potential targets include receptor-ligand pairs involved in formation of the immunological synapse . An immunological synapse is formed at the interface of the T cell and the virus-infected cell through interactions of several receptor-ligand pairs [36] . In the centre of this synapse , HLA/Ag complexes reside , engaged by specific TCRs . Costimulatory molecules locate in proximity of the Ag-presenting molecules , and are surrounded by a ring of adhesion molecules . We have observed that cellular expression of gp150 also appears to mask the adhesion molecule CD54/ICAM1 ( Fig 2A ) , the costimulatory molecule CD86 ( S6B Fig ) , as well as TfR ( S2B Fig ) , and CD10 ( Fig 2A ) . Of note , shielding of these molecules appears to require higher levels of gp150 expression than was sufficient for shielding of these Ag-presenting molecules ( S2C Fig , and Fig 2 & S3B Fig ) . In contrast , CD33 , CD44 , and CD55 were not sensitive to downregulation by gp150 , even when expressed at high levels ( Fig 2C ) , showing that gp150 does not mask all cell surface molecules . The broad target range of gp150 suggests that other receptor-ligand interactions , such as receptor-induced apoptosis by FasL-Fas interactions , or other ( non ) -immune cell-cell contacts could be disturbed by gp150 . Intriguingly , cell adherence and cell-cell contact were lost in floating MJS cells expressing high levels of gp150 ( S3A Fig ) , as was also observed for EBOV GP [29] , suggesting that gp150 can uncouple , at least partially , actively EBV-producing B cells from environmental cues . One could speculate that the EBV-producing B cell could thus become mobile by interfering with signals that restrain B cells at a particular site in the body , allowing them to localize for instance to tonsils , facilitating viral shedding in saliva . Besides the host cell molecules described above , expression of the heavily glycosylated gp150 protein could also shield the recognition of viral membrane-expressed proteins that could otherwise by recognized by EBV-specific Abs . EBV exploits the endogenous glycosylation machinery of the infected cell to form glycan structures , which are , by nature , not foreign to the immune system . When these \u201cself-structures\u201d are placed on a\u2014foreign\u2014viral protein , it could be shielded from recognition by Ab-producing B cells . In line with this , no good Abs against the extracellular part of gp150 are available . Furthermore , when the glycosylation is abundant as is the case for gp150 , it could also lead to the masking of other viral proteins that are expressed at the cell/ virus surface . So far , we have not observed strongly reduced detection of gHgL , gp350 , or gB on wild-type versus gp150-null EBV-producing B cells , and it would not be advantageous to viral entry if these receptors were fully shielded . Yet , both for EBOV GP [37] as well as for some herpesviruses , glycosylation-mediated evasion of Ab neutralization has been reported , for example for the proteins gN of HCMV and the bovine herpesvirus 4 ( BoHV-4 ) gp180 , which is the functional homologue of EBV gp350 . Truncated HCMV gN lacking part of its glycosylated ectodomain as well as absence of BoHV-4 gp180 renders viral particles more sensitive to Ab neutralization [38 , 39] . In addition , cells infected with BoHV-4 lacking gp180 show increased Ab binding to viral proteins , pointing to the role of glycans in shielding viral proteins from immune recognition . Persistent viruses dedicate a large part of their genome to modulating host antiviral activities . Among these , herpesviruses have acquired a very diverse set of strategies to downregulate Ag-presenting molecules and , thereby , T cell activation in a temporal fashion . Viral strategies include blocking protein synthesis , depletion of antigenic peptides , dislocalization to the cytoplasm followed by proteasomal degradation , re-routing and/or accelerated internalization , or steric hindrance of TCR binding [4] . In this study , we report on a novel EBV strategy: by expressing the heavily glycosylated , late EBV protein gp150 , Ag-presenting molecules on productively infected cells are shielded from interaction with TCRs , thereby allowing replication and production of viral particles that would otherwise by interrupted by a cellular immune response . This mechanism is novel in herpesvirus biology , and further supports the notion that herpesviruses use very diverse ways to achieve escape not only from T cells , but also from iNKT cell immunity . Evasion from CD1d-mediated Ag presentation supports an essential role for iNKT cells in anti-EBV immunity , which was already inferred from the devastating effects of EBV infection in XLP patients . Combining multiple strategies allows them to escape various layers of immune elimination during various stages of infection . This underscores the notion that EBV , as other herpesviruses , is extremely well adapted to persist in the face of functional immunity .\nFor T-helper cell assays , peripheral blood samples from patients and healthy individuals were obtained after approval by the LUMC institutional review board and written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki .

To determine cell viability by flow cytometry , unfixed cells were incubated with 7-AAD for 5 min at RT and subjected to flow cytometry . Live cells excluded the dye , whereas dead cells become 7-AAD positive . MJS-HLA-A2/pp65 cells were transduced with two different doses of lentivirus for gp150 expression or an empty vector control . Three days post-transduction , floating and adherent cells were harvested and adherent cells were FACS sorted for GFPhigh and GFPint cells . In 96w U-bottom plates , triplicates of 5000 cells were incubated with equal numbers of A2/pp65-specific CD8+ T cells or DR3/MiHa-specific CD4+ T cells overnight . Culture supernatants were collected to determine IFN-\u03b3 secretion by ELISA ( Affymetrix ) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol . Standard deviation was determined over biological triplicates . For MHC/peptide-TCR interactions , 293Kb cells were transfected with gp150 or an empty vector control . One day post-transfection , cells were peptide-pulsed for 2h with either 1 \u03bcM ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL peptide or the control peptide SSIEFARL . Cells were harvested and cell surface-stained using the 25D1 . 16 Ab , which is specific for Kb/SIINFEKL complexes . Samples were subjected to flow cytometry . Mean fluorescence intensity was determined for triplicates in each experiment . Statistical analysis was performed on three independent experiments using Student\u2019s t-test ( two-tailed ) . The localization of C-terminally GFP-tagged HLA-A2 expressed in MJS cells was determined by confocal microscopy .

Cell suspension was applied on a glass coverslip . Cells were analysed using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope . Microscopy images were adjusted in levels in a linear fashion . For quantification , around 30 single cells were analysed using a composite colour image of the three different channels . Images of single-stained cells ( BB7 . 2 or anti-HA ) were used to define the amount of fluorescence leakage into the regarding other channel . Prior to image quantification of double-stained cells , measured pixel intensity was corrected for the determined leakage . Pixel intensity was determined for the outer 8 pixels of the selected objects . Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t-test ( two-tailed ) . Post-nuclear cell lysates were prepared using NP40 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5% Igepal-CA630 ) containing protease inhibitors ( Roche , Protease cocktail ) , as described previously [15] . For treatment with glycosidases , lysates were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min prior to incubation with Endo H or PNGase F ( both NEB ) at 37\u00b0C for 1h . Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes . Membranes were blocked using 5% milk in PBS . The indicated primary antibodies were used to probe membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C in 1% milk in PBST ( PBS , 0 , 1% Tween 20 ) . Incubation with secondary antibody was performed for 2 hours at RT . Antibody-reactive bands were detected by ECL and signal was captured by film . Cells were cultured overnight in the presence of 25 \u03bcM chloroquine ( provided by Dr . A de Wilde ) or 15 nM epoxomicin ( provided by Dr . H Overkleeft ) to inhibit proteolysis by endolysosomal proteases or cytoplasmic proteasomes , respectively . Optimal concentration of the fluorinated P-3Fax-Neu5Ac inhibitor was determined and effectiveness of treatment was monitored by binding of the biotinylated lectins SNAI ( Sambucus nigra ) , MALII ( Maackia amurensis ) , and PNA ( Ara chishypogaea , all purchased by EY Laboratories ) . Lectin stains were performed in carbo-free blocking solution ( Vector Laboratories ) as described previously [42] . Cells were treated with 500 \u03bcM fluorinated P-3Fax-Neu5Ac inhibitor or with the control compound P-Neu5Ac 1 day prior to lentiviral transduction . Cells were cultured in presence of inhibitor for additional four days and analysed by flow cytometry . Neuraminidase treatment was performed in FACS buffer containing 1U/\u03bcl neuraminidase ( NEB ) , at 37\u00b0C for 45\u201360 min . Subsequently , cells were washed and stained in cold FACS buffer . Neuraminidase treatment was monitored by loss of binding of the biotinylated or FITC-conjugated lectin WGA ( Triticum vulgaris ) . Stained cells were subjected to flow cytometry . Fluorescence intensity signals of each analysed cell were logarithmically transformed and 1000 cells per parameter ( Figs 6 and 7B , gp150-/gp150+ , Fig 7C , latent/lytic ) were randomly picked . For each parameter , two \u201ctreatments\u201d were compared ( Figs 6D , CHO vs Lec2 , 6H , control vs inhibitor , 6L and 7B , untreated vs neuraminidase , 7C , WT vs \u0394gp150 ) . Whether treatment differences vary over gp150 expression has been explored by means of evaluating a statistical interaction between these factors in an analysis of variance model . Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVAs and significance of the interaction terms ( ctrl/gp150*untreated/treated ) was assessed using SPSS ( version 20 . 0 . 0 . 2 ) . p-values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .", "prediction": "Cell-mediated immunity plays a key role in host control of viral infection .
